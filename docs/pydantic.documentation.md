Documentation for version: [v2.11.3](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/releases/tag/v2.11.3)
.

Pydantic is the most widely used data validation library for Python.

Fast and extensible, Pydantic plays nicely with your linters/IDE/brain. Define how data should be in pure, canonical Python 3.9+; validate it with Pydantic.

Monitor Pydantic with Logfire ![🔥](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0/assets/svg/1f525.svg ":fire:")

Built by the same team as Pydantic, **[Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire)
** is an application monitoring tool that is as simple to use and powerful as Pydantic itself.

Logfire integrates with many popular Python libraries including FastAPI, OpenAI and Pydantic itself, so you can use Logfire to monitor Pydantic validations and understand why some inputs fail validation:

Monitoring Pydantic with Logfire

`from datetime import datetime  import logfire  from pydantic import BaseModel  logfire.configure() logfire.instrument_pydantic()  # (1)!  class Delivery(BaseModel):     timestamp: datetime     dimensions: tuple[int, int]  # this will record details of a successful validation to logfire m = Delivery(timestamp='2020-01-02T03:04:05Z', dimensions=['10', '20']) print(repr(m.timestamp)) #> datetime.datetime(2020, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)) print(m.dimensions) #> (10, 20)  Delivery(timestamp='2020-01-02T03:04:05Z', dimensions=['10'])  # (2)!`

1.  Set logfire record all both successful and failed validations, use `record='failure'` to only record failed validations, [learn more](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/integrations/pydantic/)
    .
2.  This will raise a `ValidationError` since there are too few `dimensions`, details of the input data and validation errors will be recorded in Logfire.

Would give you a view like this in the Logfire platform:

[![Logfire Pydantic Integration](img/logfire-pydantic-integration.png)](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/guides/web-ui/live/)

This is just a toy example, but hopefully makes clear the potential value of instrumenting a more complex application.

Why use Pydantic?[¶](#why-use-pydantic "Permanent link")

---------------------------------------------------------

*   **Powered by type hints** — with Pydantic, schema validation and serialization are controlled by type annotations; less to learn, less code to write, and integration with your IDE and static analysis tools. [Learn more…](why/#type-hints)
    
*   **Speed** — Pydantic's core validation logic is written in Rust. As a result, Pydantic is among the fastest data validation libraries for Python. [Learn more…](why/#performance)
    
*   **JSON Schema** — Pydantic models can emit JSON Schema, allowing for easy integration with other tools. [Learn more…](why/#json-schema)
    
*   **Strict** and **Lax** mode — Pydantic can run in either strict mode (where data is not converted) or lax mode where Pydantic tries to coerce data to the correct type where appropriate. [Learn more…](why/#strict-lax)
    
*   **Dataclasses**, **TypedDicts** and more — Pydantic supports validation of many standard library types including `dataclass` and `TypedDict`. [Learn more…](why/#dataclasses-typeddict-more)
    
*   **Customisation** — Pydantic allows custom validators and serializers to alter how data is processed in many powerful ways. [Learn more…](why/#customisation)
    
*   **Ecosystem** — around 8,000 packages on PyPI use Pydantic, including massively popular libraries like _FastAPI_, _huggingface_, _Django Ninja_, _SQLModel_, & _LangChain_. [Learn more…](why/#ecosystem)
    
*   **Battle tested** — Pydantic is downloaded over 70M times/month and is used by all FAANG companies and 20 of the 25 largest companies on NASDAQ. If you're trying to do something with Pydantic, someone else has probably already done it. [Learn more…](why/#using-pydantic)
    

[Installing Pydantic](install/)
 is as simple as: `pip install pydantic`

Pydantic examples[¶](#pydantic-examples "Permanent link")

----------------------------------------------------------

To see Pydantic at work, let's start with a simple example, creating a custom class that inherits from `BaseModel`:

Validation Successful

`from datetime import datetime  from pydantic import BaseModel, PositiveInt  class User(BaseModel):     id: int  # (1)!     name: str = 'John Doe'  # (2)!     signup_ts: datetime | None  # (3)!     tastes: dict[str, PositiveInt]  # (4)!  external_data = {     'id': 123,     'signup_ts': '2019-06-01 12:22',  # (5)!     'tastes': {         'wine': 9,         b'cheese': 7,  # (6)!         'cabbage': '1',  # (7)!     }, }  user = User(**external_data)  # (8)!  print(user.id)  # (9)! #> 123 print(user.model_dump())  # (10)! """ {     'id': 123,     'name': 'John Doe',     'signup_ts': datetime.datetime(2019, 6, 1, 12, 22),     'tastes': {'wine': 9, 'cheese': 7, 'cabbage': 1}, } """`

1.  `id` is of type `int`; the annotation-only declaration tells Pydantic that this field is required. Strings, bytes, or floats will be coerced to integers if possible; otherwise an exception will be raised.
2.  `name` is a string; because it has a default, it is not required.
3.  `signup_ts` is a [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime)
     field that is required, but the value `None` may be provided; Pydantic will process either a [Unix timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)
     integer (e.g. `1496498400`) or a string representing the date and time.
4.  `tastes` is a dictionary with string keys and positive integer values. The `PositiveInt` type is shorthand for `Annotated[int, annotated_types.Gt(0)]`.
5.  The input here is an [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)
     formatted datetime, but Pydantic will convert it to a [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime)
     object.
6.  The key here is `bytes`, but Pydantic will take care of coercing it to a string.
7.  Similarly, Pydantic will coerce the string `'1'` to the integer `1`.
8.  We create instance of `User` by passing our external data to `User` as keyword arguments.
9.  We can access fields as attributes of the model.
10.  We can convert the model to a dictionary with [`model_dump()`](api/base_model/#pydantic.BaseModel.model_dump)
    .

If validation fails, Pydantic will raise an error with a breakdown of what was wrong:

Validation Error

`# continuing the above example...  from datetime import datetime from pydantic import BaseModel, PositiveInt, ValidationError  class User(BaseModel):     id: int     name: str = 'John Doe'     signup_ts: datetime | None     tastes: dict[str, PositiveInt]  external_data = {'id': 'not an int', 'tastes': {}}  # (1)!  try:     User(**external_data)  # (2)! except ValidationError as e:     print(e.errors())     """     [         {             'type': 'int_parsing',             'loc': ('id',),             'msg': 'Input should be a valid integer, unable to parse string as an integer',             'input': 'not an int',             'url': 'https://errors.pydantic.dev/2/v/int_parsing',         },         {             'type': 'missing',             'loc': ('signup_ts',),             'msg': 'Field required',             'input': {'id': 'not an int', 'tastes': {}},             'url': 'https://errors.pydantic.dev/2/v/missing',         },     ]     """`

1.  The input data is wrong here — `id` is not a valid integer, and `signup_ts` is missing.
2.  Trying to instantiate `User` will raise a [`ValidationError`](api/pydantic_core/#pydantic_core.ValidationError)
     with a list of errors.

If you're using Pydantic prior to **v2.0** please use:

`python -c "import pydantic.utils; print(pydantic.utils.version_info())"`

Please try to always include the above unless you're unable to install Pydantic or **know** it's not relevant to your question or feature request.

Pull Requests[¶](#pull-requests "Permanent link")

--------------------------------------------------

It should be extremely simple to get started and create a Pull Request. Pydantic is released regularly so you should see your improvements release in a matter of days or weeks 🚀.

Unless your change is trivial (typo, docs tweak etc.), please create an issue to discuss the change before creating a pull request.

Pydantic V1 is in maintenance mode

Pydantic v1 is in maintenance mode, meaning that only bug fixes and security fixes will be accepted. New features should be targeted at Pydantic v2.

To submit a fix to Pydantic v1, use the `1.10.X-fixes` as a target branch.

If you're looking for something to get your teeth into, check out the ["help wanted"](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
 label on github.

To make contributing as easy and fast as possible, you'll want to run tests and linting locally. Luckily, Pydantic has few dependencies, doesn't require compiling and tests don't need access to databases, etc. Because of this, setting up and running the tests should be very simple.

Tip

**tl;dr**: use `make format` to fix formatting, `make` to run tests and linting and `make docs` to build the docs.

### Prerequisites[¶](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

You'll need the following prerequisites:

*   Any Python version between **Python 3.9 and 3.12**
*   [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
     or other virtual environment tool
*   **git**
*   **make**

### Installation and setup[¶](#installation-and-setup "Permanent link")

Fork the repository on GitHub and clone your fork locally.

`# Clone your fork and cd into the repo directory git clone [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) :<your username>/pydantic.git cd pydantic  # Install UV and pre-commit # We use pipx here, for other options see: # https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/ # https://pre-commit.com/#install # To get pipx itself: # https://pypa.github.io/pipx/ pipx install uv pipx install pre-commit  # Install pydantic, dependencies, test dependencies and doc dependencies make install`

### Check out a new branch and make your changes[¶](#check-out-a-new-branch-and-make-your-changes "Permanent link")

Create a new branch for your changes.

`# Checkout a new branch and make your changes git checkout -b my-new-feature-branch # Make your changes...`

### Run tests and linting[¶](#run-tests-and-linting "Permanent link")

Run tests and linting locally to make sure everything is working as expected.

``# Run automated code formatting and linting make format # Pydantic uses ruff, an awesome Python linter written in rust # https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff  # Run tests and linting make # There are a few sub-commands in Makefile like `test`, `testcov` and `lint` # which you might want to use, but generally just `make` should be all you need. # You can run `make help` to see more options.``

### Build documentation[¶](#build-documentation "Permanent link")

If you've made any changes to the documentation (including changes to function signatures, class definitions, or docstrings that will appear in the API documentation), make sure it builds successfully.

We use `mkdocs-material[imaging]` to support social previews. You can find directions on how to install the required dependencies [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/plugins/requirements/image-processing/)
.

``# Build documentation make docs # If you have changed the documentation, make sure it builds successfully. # You can also use `uv run mkdocs serve` to serve the documentation at localhost:8000``

If this isn't working due to issues with the imaging plugin, try commenting out the `social` plugin line in `mkdocs.yml` and running `make docs` again.

#### Updating the documentation[¶](#updating-the-documentation "Permanent link")

We push a new version of the documentation with each minor release, and we push to a `dev` path with each commit to `main`.

If you're updating the documentation out of cycle with a minor release and want your changes to be reflected on `latest`, do the following:

1.  Open a PR against `main` with your docs changes
2.  Once the PR is merged, checkout the `docs-update` branch. This branch should be up to date with the latest patch release. For example, if the latest release is `v2.9.2`, you should make sure `docs-update` is up to date with the `v2.9.2` tag.
3.  Checkout a new branch from `docs-update` and cherry-pick your changes onto this branch.
4.  Push your changes and open a PR against `docs-update`.
5.  Once the PR is merged, the new docs will be built and deployed.

Note

Maintainer shortcut - as a maintainer, you can skip the second PR and just cherry pick directly onto the `docs-update` branch.

### Commit and push your changes[¶](#commit-and-push-your-changes "Permanent link")

Commit your changes, push your branch to GitHub, and create a pull request.

Please follow the pull request template and fill in as much information as possible. Link to any relevant issues and include a description of your changes.

When your pull request is ready for review, add a comment with the message "please review" and we'll take a look as soon as we can.

Documentation style[¶](#documentation-style "Permanent link")

--------------------------------------------------------------

Documentation is written in Markdown and built using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
. API documentation is build from docstrings using [mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/)
.

### Code documentation[¶](#code-documentation "Permanent link")

When contributing to Pydantic, please make sure that all code is well documented. The following should be documented using properly formatted docstrings:

*   Modules
*   Class definitions
*   Function definitions
*   Module-level variables

Pydantic uses [Google-style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings)
 formatted according to [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)
 guidelines. (See [Example Google Style Python Docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)
 for further examples.)

[pydocstyle](https://www.pydocstyle.org/en/stable/index.html)
 is used for linting docstrings. You can run `make format` to check your docstrings.

Where this is a conflict between Google-style docstrings and pydocstyle linting, follow the pydocstyle linting hints.

Class attributes and function arguments should be documented in the format "name: description." When applicable, a return type should be documented with just a description. Types are inferred from the signature.

`class Foo:     """A class docstring.      Attributes:         bar: A description of bar. Defaults to "bar".     """      bar: str = 'bar'`

``def bar(self, baz: int) -> str:     """A function docstring.      Args:         baz: A description of `baz`.      Returns:         A description of the return value.     """      return 'bar'``

You may include example code in docstrings. This code should be complete, self-contained, and runnable. Docstring examples are tested, so make sure they are correct and complete. See [`FieldInfo.from_annotated_attribute`](../api/fields/#pydantic.fields.FieldInfo.from_annotated_attribute)
 for an example.

Class and instance attributes

Class attributes should be documented in the class docstring.

Instance attributes should be documented as "Args" in the `__init__` docstring.

### Documentation Style[¶](#documentation-style_1 "Permanent link")

In general, documentation should be written in a friendly, approachable style. It should be easy to read and understand, and should be as concise as possible while still being complete.

Code examples are encouraged, but should be kept short and simple. However, every code example should be complete, self-contained, and runnable. (If you're not sure how to do this, ask for help!) We prefer print output to naked asserts, but if you're testing something that doesn't have a useful print output, asserts are fine.

Pydantic's unit test will test all code examples in the documentation, so it's important that they are correct and complete. When adding a new code example, use the following to test examples and update their formatting and output:

`# Run tests and update code examples pytest tests/test_docs.py --update-examples`

Debugging Python and Rust[¶](#debugging-python-and-rust "Permanent link")

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're working with `pydantic` and `pydantic-core`, you might find it helpful to debug Python and Rust code together. Here's a quick guide on how to do that. This tutorial is done in VSCode, but you can use similar steps in other IDEs.

Adding your library as part of Pydantic's third party test suite[¶](#adding-your-library-as-part-of-pydantics-third-party-test-suite "Permanent link")

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To be able to identify regressions early during development, Pydantic runs tests on various third-party projects using Pydantic. We consider adding support for testing new open source projects (that rely heavily on Pydantic) if your said project matches some of the following criteria:

*   The project is actively maintained.
*   The project makes use of Pydantic internals (e.g. relying on the [`BaseModel`](../api/base_model/#pydantic.BaseModel)
     metaclass, typing utilities).
*   The project is popular enough (although small projects can still be included depending on how Pydantic is being used).
*   The project CI is simple enough to be ported into Pydantic's testing workflow.

If your project meets some of these criteria, you can [open feature request](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature+request&projects=&template=feature_request.yml)
 to discuss the inclusion of your project.

# Installation - Pydantic

 



Installation
============

Installation is as simple as:

pipuv

`pip install pydantic`

`uv add pydantic`

Pydantic has a few dependencies:

*   [`pydantic-core`](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic-core/)
    : Core validation logic for Pydantic written in Rust.
*   [`typing-extensions`](https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/)
    : Backport of the standard library [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#module-typing)
     module.
*   [`annotated-types`](https://pypi.org/project/annotated-types/)
    : Reusable constraint types to use with [`typing.Annotated`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Annotated)
    .

If you've got Python 3.9+ and `pip` installed, you're good to go.

Pydantic is also available on [conda](https://www.anaconda.com)
 under the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org)
 channel:

`conda install pydantic -c conda-forge`

Optional dependencies[¶](#optional-dependencies "Permanent link")

------------------------------------------------------------------

Pydantic has the following optional dependencies:

*   `email`: Email validation provided by the [email-validator](https://pypi.org/project/email-validator/)
     package.
*   `timezone`: Fallback IANA time zone database provided by the [tzdata](https://pypi.org/project/tzdata/)
     package.

To install optional dependencies along with Pydantic:

pipuv

``# with the `email` extra: pip install 'pydantic[email]' # or with `email` and `timezone` extras: pip install 'pydantic[email,timezone]'``

``# with the `email` extra: uv add 'pydantic[email]' # or with `email` and `timezone` extras: uv add 'pydantic[email,timezone]'``

Of course, you can also install requirements manually with `pip install email-validator tzdata`.

Install from repository[¶](#install-from-repository "Permanent link")

----------------------------------------------------------------------

And if you prefer to install Pydantic directly from the repository:

pipuv

``pip install 'git+https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic@main' # or with `email` and `timezone` extras: pip install 'git+https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic@main#egg=pydantic[email,timezone]'``

``uv add 'git+https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic@main' # or with `email` and `timezone` extras: uv add 'git+https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic@main#egg=pydantic[email,timezone]'``

# Annotated Handlers - Pydantic

 



Annotated Handlers
==================

Type annotations to use with `__get_pydantic_core_schema__` and `__get_pydantic_json_schema__`.

GetJsonSchemaHandler [¶](#pydantic.annotated_handlers.GetJsonSchemaHandler "Permanent link")

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Handler to call into the next JSON schema generation function.

Attributes:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mode` | `[JsonSchemaMode](../json_schema/#pydantic.json_schema.JsonSchemaMode "pydantic.json_schema.JsonSchemaMode") ` | Json schema mode, can be `validation` or `serialization`. |

### resolve\_ref\_schema [¶](#pydantic.annotated_handlers.GetJsonSchemaHandler.resolve_ref_schema "Permanent link")

`resolve_ref_schema(     maybe_ref_json_schema: [JsonSchemaValue](../json_schema/#pydantic.json_schema.JsonSchemaValue "pydantic.json_schema.JsonSchemaValue") , ) -> [JsonSchemaValue](../json_schema/#pydantic.json_schema.JsonSchemaValue "pydantic.json_schema.JsonSchemaValue")`

Get the real schema for a `{"$ref": ...}` schema. If the schema given is not a `$ref` schema, it will be returned as is. This means you don't have to check before calling this function.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `maybe_ref_json_schema` | `[JsonSchemaValue](../json_schema/#pydantic.json_schema.JsonSchemaValue "pydantic.json_schema.JsonSchemaValue") ` | A JsonSchemaValue which may be a `$ref` schema. | _required_ |

Raises:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `[LookupError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#LookupError) ` | If the ref is not found. |

Returns:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `JsonSchemaValue` | `[JsonSchemaValue](../json_schema/#pydantic.json_schema.JsonSchemaValue "pydantic.json_schema.JsonSchemaValue") ` | A JsonSchemaValue that has no `$ref`. |

`generate_schema(source_type: [Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") ) -> CoreSchema`

Generate a schema unrelated to the current context. Use this function if e.g. you are handling schema generation for a sequence and want to generate a schema for its items. Otherwise, you may end up doing something like applying a `min_length` constraint that was intended for the sequence itself to its items!

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `source_type` | `[Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") ` | The input type. | _required_ |

v1.10.0 (2022-08-30)[¶](#v1100-2022-08-30 "Permanent link")

------------------------------------------------------------

*   Refactor the whole _pydantic_ `dataclass` decorator to really act like its standard lib equivalent. It hence keeps `__eq__`, `__hash__`, ... and makes comparison with its non-validated version possible. It also fixes usage of `frozen` dataclasses in fields and usage of `default_factory` in nested dataclasses. The support of `Config.extra` has been added. Finally, config customization directly via a `dict` is now possible, [#2557](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/2557)
     by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)
      
      
    **BREAKING CHANGES:**
*   The `compiled` boolean (whether _pydantic_ is compiled with cython) has been moved from `main.py` to `version.py`
*   Now that `Config.extra` is supported, `dataclass` ignores by default extra arguments (like `BaseModel`)

v1.9.2 (2022-08-11)[¶](#v192-2022-08-11 "Permanent link")

----------------------------------------------------------

**Revert Breaking Change**: _v1.9.1_ introduced a breaking change where model fields were deep copied by default, this release reverts the default behaviour to match _v1.9.0_ and before, while also allow deep-copy behaviour via `copy_on_model_validation = 'deep'`. See [#4092](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/4092)
 for more information.

*   Allow for shallow copies of model fields, `Config.copy_on_model_validation` is now a str which must be `'none'`, `'deep'`, or `'shallow'` corresponding to not copying, deep copy & shallow copy; default `'shallow'`, [#4093](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/4093)

     by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)\
    \
*   Add a [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/)\
     plugin for easier [property-based testing](https://increment.com/testing/in-praise-of-property-based-testing/)\

     by [@TrDex](https://github.com/TrDex)\
    \
*   Add a new `frozen` boolean parameter to `Config` (default: `False`). Setting `frozen=True` does everything that `allow_mutation=False` does, and also generates a `__hash__()` method for the model. This makes instances of the model potentially hashable if all the attributes are hashable, [#1880](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1880)\

     by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)\
    \
*   Fix bug where generic models with fields where the typevar is nested in another type `a: List[T]` are considered to be concrete. This allows these models to be subclassed and composed as expected, [#947](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/947)\
     by [@daviskirk](https://github.com/daviskirk)\
    \
*   Add `Config.copy_on_model_validation` flag. When set to `False`, _pydantic_ will keep models used as fields untouched on validation instead of reconstructing (copying) them, [#265](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/265)\

     by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)\
    \
*   Change default value of `__module__` argument of `create_model` from `None` to `'pydantic.main'`. Set reference of created concrete model to it's module to allow pickling (not applied to models created in functions), [#1686](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1686)\

    \
*   Use `chain.from_iterable` in class\_validators.py. This is a faster and more idiomatic way of using `itertools.chain`. Instead of computing all the items in the iterable and storing them in memory, they are computed one-by-one and never stored as a huge list.

# Migration Guide - Pydantic

 



Migration Guide
===============

Pydantic V2 introduces a number of changes to the API, including some breaking changes.

This page provides a guide highlighting the most important changes to help you migrate your code from Pydantic V1 to Pydantic V2.

Install Pydantic V2[¶](#install-pydantic-v2 "Permanent link")

--------------------------------------------------------------

Pydantic V2 is now the current production release of Pydantic. You can install Pydantic V2 from PyPI:

`pip install -U pydantic`

If you encounter any issues, please [create an issue in GitHub](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues)
 using the `bug V2` label. This will help us to actively monitor and track errors, and to continue to improve the library's performance.

If you need to use latest Pydantic V1 for any reason, see the [Continue using Pydantic V1 features](#continue-using-pydantic-v1-features)
 section below for details on installation and imports from `pydantic.v1`.

Code transformation tool[¶](#code-transformation-tool "Permanent link")

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have created a tool to help you migrate your code. This tool is still in beta, but we hope it will help you to migrate your code more quickly.

You can install the tool from PyPI:

`pip install bump-pydantic`

The usage is simple. If your project structure is:

`* repo_folder     * my_package         * <python source files> ...`

Then you'll want to do:

`cd /path/to/repo_folder bump-pydantic my_package`

See more about it on the [Bump Pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/bump-pydantic)
 repository.

Continue using Pydantic V1 features[¶](#continue-using-pydantic-v1-features "Permanent link")

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pydantic V1 is still available when you need it, though we recommend migrating to Pydantic V2 for its improvements and new features.

If you need to use latest Pydantic V1, you can install it with:

`pip install "pydantic==1.*"`

The Pydantic V2 package also continues to provide access to the Pydantic V1 API by importing through `pydantic.v1`.

For example, you can use the `BaseModel` class from Pydantic V1 instead of the Pydantic V2 `pydantic.BaseModel` class:

`from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel`

You can also import functions that have been removed from Pydantic V2, such as `lenient_isinstance`:

`from pydantic.v1.utils import lenient_isinstance`

Pydantic V1 documentation is available at [https://docs.pydantic.dev/1.10/](https://docs.pydantic.dev/1.10/)
.

### Using Pydantic v1 features in a v1/v2 environment[¶](#using-pydantic-v1-features-in-a-v1v2-environment "Permanent link")

As of `pydantic>=1.10.17`, the `pydantic.v1` namespace can be used within V1. This makes it easier to migrate to V2, which also supports the `pydantic.v1` namespace. In order to unpin a `pydantic<2` dependency and continue using V1 features, take the following steps:

1.  Replace `pydantic<2` with `pydantic>=1.10.17`
2.  Find and replace all occurrences of:

`from pydantic.<module> import <object>`

with:

`from pydantic.v1.<module> import <object>`

Here's how you can import `pydantic`'s v1 features based on your version of `pydantic`:

`pydantic>=1.10.17,<3``pydantic<3`

As of `v1.10.17` the `.v1` namespace is available in V1, allowing imports as below:

`from pydantic.v1.fields import ModelField`

All versions of Pydantic V1 and V2 support the following import pattern, in case you don't know which version of Pydantic you are using:

`try:     from pydantic.v1.fields import ModelField except ImportError:     from pydantic.fields import ModelField`

Note

When importing modules using `pydantic>=1.10.17,<2` with the `.v1` namespace these modules will _not_ be the **same** module as the same import without the `.v1` namespace, but the symbols imported _will_ be. For example `pydantic.v1.fields is not pydantic.fields` but `pydantic.v1.fields.ModelField is pydantic.fields.ModelField`. Luckily, this is not likely to be relevant in the vast majority of cases. It's just an unfortunate consequence of providing a smoother migration experience.

Migration guide[¶](#migration-guide "Permanent link")

------------------------------------------------------

The following sections provide details on the most important changes in Pydantic V2.

### Changes to `pydantic.BaseModel`[¶](#changes-to-pydanticbasemodel "Permanent link")

Various method names have been changed; all non-deprecated `BaseModel` methods now have names matching either the format `model_.*` or `__.*pydantic.*__`. Where possible, we have retained the deprecated methods with their old names to help ease migration, but calling them will emit `DeprecationWarning`s.

| Pydantic V1 | Pydantic V2 |
| --- | --- |
| `__fields__` | `model_fields` |
| `__private_attributes__` | `__pydantic_private__` |
| `__validators__` | `__pydantic_validator__` |
| `construct()` | `model_construct()` |
| `copy()` | `model_copy()` |
| `dict()` | `model_dump()` |
| `json_schema()` | `model_json_schema()` |
| `json()` | `model_dump_json()` |
| `parse_obj()` | `model_validate()` |
| `update_forward_refs()` | `model_rebuild()` |

*   Some of the built-in data-loading functionality has been slated for removal. In particular, `parse_raw` and `parse_file` are now deprecated. In Pydantic V2, `model_validate_json` works like `parse_raw`. Otherwise, you should load the data and then pass it to `model_validate`.
*   The `from_orm` method has been deprecated; you can now just use `model_validate` (equivalent to `parse_obj` from Pydantic V1) to achieve something similar, as long as you've set `from_attributes=True` in the model config.
*   The `__eq__` method has changed for models.
    *   Models can only be equal to other `BaseModel` instances.
    *   For two model instances to be equal, they must have the same:
        *   Type (or, in the case of generic models, non-parametrized generic origin type)
        *   Field values
        *   Extra values (only relevant when `model_config['extra'] == 'allow'`)
        *   Private attribute values; models with different values of private attributes are no longer equal.
        *   Models are no longer equal to the dicts containing their data.
        *   Non-generic models of different types are never equal.
        *   Generic models with different origin types are never equal. We don't require _exact_ type equality so that, for example, instances of `MyGenericModel[Any]` could be equal to instances of `MyGenericModel[int]`.
*   We have replaced the use of the `__root__` field to specify a "custom root model" with a new type called [`RootModel`](../concepts/models/#rootmodel-and-custom-root-types)
     which is intended to replace the functionality of using a field called `__root__` in Pydantic V1. Note, `RootModel` types no longer support the `arbitrary_types_allowed` config setting. See [this issue comment](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/6710#issuecomment-1700948167)
     for an explanation.
*   We have significantly expanded Pydantic's capabilities related to customizing serialization. In particular, we have added the [`@field_serializer`](../api/functional_serializers/#pydantic.functional_serializers.field_serializer)
    , [`@model_serializer`](../api/functional_serializers/#pydantic.functional_serializers.model_serializer)
    , and [`@computed_field`](../api/fields/#pydantic.fields.computed_field)
     decorators, which each address various shortcomings from Pydantic V1.
    *   See [Custom serializers](../concepts/serialization/#custom-serializers)
         for the usage docs of these new decorators.
    *   Due to performance overhead and implementation complexity, we have now deprecated support for specifying `json_encoders` in the model config. This functionality was originally added for the purpose of achieving custom serialization logic, and we think the new serialization decorators are a better choice in most common scenarios.
*   We have changed the behavior related to serializing subclasses of models when they occur as nested fields in a parent model. In V1, we would always include all fields from the subclass instance. In V2, when we dump a model, we only include the fields that are defined on the annotated type of the field. This helps prevent some accidental security bugs. You can read more about this (including how to opt out of this behavior) in the [Subclass instances for fields of BaseModel, dataclasses, TypedDict](../concepts/serialization/#subclass-instances-for-fields-of-basemodel-dataclasses-typeddict)
     section of the model exporting docs.
*   `GetterDict` has been removed as it was just an implementation detail of `orm_mode`, which has been removed.
*   In many cases, arguments passed to the constructor will be **copied** in order to perform validation and, where necessary, coercion. This is notable in the case of passing mutable objects as arguments to a constructor. You can see an example + more detail [here](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/#attribute-copies)
    .
*   The `.json()` method is deprecated, and attempting to use this deprecated method with arguments such as `indent` or `ensure_ascii` may lead to confusing errors. For best results, switch to V2's equivalent, `model_dump_json()`. If you'd still like to use said arguments, you can use [this workaround](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/8825#issuecomment-1946206415)
    .
*   JSON serialization of non-string key values is generally done with `str(key)`, leading to some changes in behavior such as the following:

`from typing import Optional  from pydantic import BaseModel as V2BaseModel from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel as V1BaseModel  class V1Model(V1BaseModel):     a: dict[Optional[str], int]  class V2Model(V2BaseModel):     a: dict[Optional[str], int]  v1_model = V1Model(a={None: 123}) v2_model = V2Model(a={None: 123})  # V1 print(v1_model.json()) #> {"a": {"null": 123}}  # V2 print(v2_model.model_dump_json()) #> {"a":{"None":123}}`

*   `model_dump_json()` results are compacted in order to save space, and don't always exactly match that of `json.dumps()` output. That being said, you can easily modify the separators used in `json.dumps()` results in order to align the two outputs:

`import json  from pydantic import BaseModel as V2BaseModel from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel as V1BaseModel  class V1Model(V1BaseModel):     a: list[str]  class V2Model(V2BaseModel):     a: list[str]  v1_model = V1Model(a=['fancy', 'sushi']) v2_model = V2Model(a=['fancy', 'sushi'])  # V1 print(v1_model.json()) #> {"a": ["fancy", "sushi"]}  # V2 print(v2_model.model_dump_json()) #> {"a":["fancy","sushi"]}  # Plain json.dumps print(json.dumps(v2_model.model_dump())) #> {"a": ["fancy", "sushi"]}  # Modified json.dumps print(json.dumps(v2_model.model_dump(), separators=(',', ':'))) #> {"a":["fancy","sushi"]}`

### Changes to `pydantic.generics.GenericModel`[¶](#changes-to-pydanticgenericsgenericmodel "Permanent link")

The `pydantic.generics.GenericModel` class is no longer necessary, and has been removed. Instead, you can now create generic `BaseModel` subclasses by just adding `Generic` as a parent class on a `BaseModel` subclass directly. This looks like `class MyGenericModel(BaseModel, Generic[T]): ...`.

Mixing of V1 and V2 models is not supported which means that type parameters of such generic `BaseModel` (V2) cannot be V1 models.

While it may not raise an error, we strongly advise against using _parametrized_ generics in `isinstance` checks.

*   For example, you should not do `isinstance(my_model, MyGenericModel[int])`. However, it is fine to do `isinstance(my_model, MyGenericModel)`. (Note that for standard generics, it would raise an error to do a subclass check with a parameterized generic.)
*   If you need to perform `isinstance` checks against parametrized generics, you can do this by subclassing the parametrized generic class. This looks like `class MyIntModel(MyGenericModel[int]): ...` and `isinstance(my_model, MyIntModel)`.

Find more information in the [Generic models](../concepts/models/#generic-models)
 documentation.

### Changes to `pydantic.Field`[¶](#changes-to-pydanticfield "Permanent link")

`Field` no longer supports arbitrary keyword arguments to be added to the JSON schema. Instead, any extra data you want to add to the JSON schema should be passed as a dictionary to the `json_schema_extra` keyword argument.

In Pydantic V1, the `alias` property returns the field's name when no alias is set. In Pydantic V2, this behavior has changed to return `None` when no alias is set.

The following properties have been removed from or changed in `Field`:

*   `const`
*   `min_items` (use `min_length` instead)
*   `max_items` (use `max_length` instead)
*   `unique_items`
*   `allow_mutation` (use `frozen` instead)
*   `regex` (use `pattern` instead)
*   `final` (use the [typing.Final](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Final)
     type hint instead)

Field constraints are no longer automatically pushed down to the parameters of generics. For example, you can no longer validate every element of a list matches a regex by providing `my_list: list[str] = Field(pattern=".*")`. Instead, use [`typing.Annotated`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Annotated)
 to provide an annotation on the `str` itself: `my_list: list[Annotated[str, Field(pattern=".*")]]`

### Changes to dataclasses[¶](#changes-to-dataclasses "Permanent link")

Pydantic [dataclasses](../concepts/dataclasses/)
 continue to be useful for enabling the data validation on standard dataclasses without having to subclass `BaseModel`. Pydantic V2 introduces the following changes to this dataclass behavior:

*   When used as fields, dataclasses (Pydantic or vanilla) no longer accept tuples as validation inputs; dicts should be used instead.
*   The `__post_init__` in Pydantic dataclasses will now be called _after_ validation, rather than before.
    *   As a result, the `__post_init_post_parse__` method would have become redundant, so has been removed.
*   Pydantic no longer supports `extra='allow'` for Pydantic dataclasses, where extra fields passed to the initializer would be stored as extra attributes on the dataclass. `extra='ignore'` is still supported for the purpose of ignoring unexpected fields while parsing data, they just won't be stored on the instance.
*   Pydantic dataclasses no longer have an attribute `__pydantic_model__`, and no longer use an underlying `BaseModel` to perform validation or provide other functionality.
    *   To perform validation, generate a JSON schema, or make use of any other functionality that may have required `__pydantic_model__` in V1, you should now wrap the dataclass with a [`TypeAdapter`](../api/type_adapter/#pydantic.type_adapter.TypeAdapter)
         ([discussed more below](#introduction-of-typeadapter)
        ) and make use of its methods.
*   In Pydantic V1, if you used a vanilla (i.e., non-Pydantic) dataclass as a field, the config of the parent type would be used as though it was the config for the dataclass itself as well. In Pydantic V2, this is no longer the case.
    *   In Pydantic V2, to override the config (like you would with `model_config` on a `BaseModel`), you can use the `config` parameter on the `@dataclass` decorator. See [Dataclass Config](../concepts/dataclasses/#dataclass-config)
         for examples.

### Changes to config[¶](#changes-to-config "Permanent link")

*   In Pydantic V2, to specify config on a model, you should set a class attribute called `model_config` to be a dict with the key/value pairs you want to be used as the config. The Pydantic V1 behavior to create a class called `Config` in the namespace of the parent `BaseModel` subclass is now deprecated.
    
*   When subclassing a model, the `model_config` attribute is inherited. This is helpful in the case where you'd like to use a base class with a given configuration for many models. Note, if you inherit from multiple `BaseModel` subclasses, like `class MyModel(Model1, Model2)`, the non-default settings in the `model_config` attribute from the two models will be merged, and for any settings defined in both, those from `Model2` will override those from `Model1`.
    
*   The following config settings have been removed:
    
    *   `allow_mutation` — this has been removed. You should be able to use [frozen](../api/config/#pydantic.config.ConfigDict)
         equivalently (inverse of current use).
    *   `error_msg_templates`
    *   `fields` — this was the source of various bugs, so has been removed. You should be able to use `Annotated` on fields to modify them as desired.
    *   `getter_dict` — `orm_mode` has been removed, and this implementation detail is no longer necessary.
    *   `smart_union` - the default `union_mode` in Pydantic V2 is `'smart'`.
    *   `underscore_attrs_are_private` — the Pydantic V2 behavior is now the same as if this was always set to `True` in Pydantic V1.
    *   `json_loads`
    *   `json_dumps`
    *   `copy_on_model_validation`
    *   `post_init_call`
*   The following config settings have been renamed:
    
    *   `allow_population_by_field_name` → `populate_by_name` (or `validate_by_name` starting in v2.11)
    *   `anystr_lower` → `str_to_lower`
    *   `anystr_strip_whitespace` → `str_strip_whitespace`
    *   `anystr_upper` → `str_to_upper`
    *   `keep_untouched` → `ignored_types`
    *   `max_anystr_length` → `str_max_length`
    *   `min_anystr_length` → `str_min_length`
    *   `orm_mode` → `from_attributes`
    *   `schema_extra` → `json_schema_extra`
    *   `validate_all` → `validate_default`

See the [`ConfigDict` API reference](../api/config/#pydantic.config.ConfigDict)
 for more details.

### Changes to validators[¶](#changes-to-validators "Permanent link")

#### `@validator` and `@root_validator` are deprecated[¶](#validator-and-root_validator-are-deprecated "Permanent link")

*   `@validator` has been deprecated, and should be replaced with [`@field_validator`](../concepts/validators/)
    , which provides various new features and improvements.
    *   The new `@field_validator` decorator does not have the `each_item` keyword argument; validators you want to apply to items within a generic container should be added by annotating the type argument. See [validators in Annotated metadata](../concepts/types/#using-the-annotated-pattern)
         for details. This looks like `list[Annotated[int, Field(ge=0)]]`
    *   Even if you keep using the deprecated `@validator` decorator, you can no longer add the `field` or `config` arguments to the signature of validator functions. If you need access to these, you'll need to migrate to `@field_validator` — see the [next section](#changes-to-validators-allowed-signatures)
         for more details.
    *   If you use the `always=True` keyword argument to a validator function, note that standard validators for the annotated type will _also_ be applied even to defaults, not just the custom validators. For example, despite the fact that the validator below will never error, the following code raises a `ValidationError`:

Note

To avoid this, you can use the `validate_default` argument in the `Field` function. When set to `True`, it mimics the behavior of `always=True` in Pydantic v1. However, the new way of using `validate_default` is encouraged as it provides more flexibility and control.

`from pydantic import BaseModel, validator  class Model(BaseModel):     x: str = 1      @validator('x', always=True)     @classmethod     def validate_x(cls, v):         return v  Model()`

*   `@root_validator` has been deprecated, and should be replaced with [`@model_validator`](../api/functional_validators/#pydantic.functional_validators.model_validator)
    , which also provides new features and improvements.
    *   Under some circumstances (such as assignment when `model_config['validate_assignment'] is True`), the `@model_validator` decorator will receive an instance of the model, not a dict of values. You may need to be careful to handle this case.
    *   Even if you keep using the deprecated `@root_validator` decorator, due to refactors in validation logic, you can no longer run with `skip_on_failure=False` (which is the default value of this keyword argument, so must be set explicitly to `True`).

#### Changes to `@validator`'s allowed signatures[¶](#changes-to-validators-allowed-signatures "Permanent link")

In Pydantic V1, functions wrapped by `@validator` could receive keyword arguments with metadata about what was being validated. Some of these arguments have been removed from `@field_validator` in Pydantic V2:

*   `config`: Pydantic V2's config is now a dictionary instead of a class, which means this argument is no longer backwards compatible. If you need to access the configuration you should migrate to `@field_validator` and use `info.config`.
*   `field`: this argument used to be a `ModelField` object, which was a quasi-internal class that no longer exists in Pydantic V2. Most of this information can still be accessed by using the field name from `info.field_name` to index into `cls.model_fields`

`from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationInfo, field_validator  class Model(BaseModel):     x: int      @field_validator('x')     def val_x(cls, v: int, info: ValidationInfo) -> int:         assert info.config is not None         print(info.config.get('title'))         #> Model         print(cls.model_fields[info.field_name].is_required())         #> True         return v  Model(x=1)`

#### `TypeError` is no longer converted to `ValidationError` in validators[¶](#typeerror-is-no-longer-converted-to-validationerror-in-validators "Permanent link")

Previously, when raising a `TypeError` within a validator function, that error would be wrapped into a `ValidationError` and, in some cases (such as with FastAPI), these errors might be displayed to end users. This led to a variety of undesirable behavior — for example, calling a function with the wrong signature might produce a user-facing `ValidationError`.

However, in Pydantic V2, when a `TypeError` is raised in a validator, it is no longer converted into a `ValidationError`:

`import pytest  from pydantic import BaseModel, field_validator  # or validator  class Model(BaseModel):     x: int      @field_validator('x')     def val_x(cls, v: int) -> int:         return str.lower(v)  # raises a TypeError  with pytest.raises(TypeError):     Model(x=1)`

This applies to all validation decorators.

#### Validator behavior changes[¶](#validator-behavior-changes "Permanent link")

Pydantic V2 includes some changes to type coercion. For example:

*   coercing `int`, `float`, and `Decimal` values to strings is now optional and disabled by default, see [Coerce Numbers to Strings](../api/config/#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.coerce_numbers_to_str)
    .
*   iterable of pairs is no longer coerced to a dict.

See the [Conversion table](../concepts/conversion_table/)
 for details on Pydantic V2 type coercion defaults.

#### The `allow_reuse` keyword argument is no longer necessary[¶](#the-allow_reuse-keyword-argument-is-no-longer-necessary "Permanent link")

Previously, Pydantic tracked "reused" functions in decorators as this was a common source of mistakes. We did this by comparing the function's fully qualified name (module name + function name), which could result in false positives. The `allow_reuse` keyword argument could be used to disable this when it was intentional.

Our approach to detecting repeatedly defined functions has been overhauled to only error for redefinition within a single class, reducing false positives and bringing the behavior more in line with the errors that type checkers and linters would give for defining a method with the same name multiple times in a single class definition.

In nearly all cases, if you were using `allow_reuse=True`, you should be able to simply delete that keyword argument and have things keep working as expected.

#### `@validate_arguments` has been renamed to `@validate_call`[¶](#validate_arguments-has-been-renamed-to-validate_call "Permanent link")

In Pydantic V2, the `@validate_arguments` decorator has been renamed to `@validate_call`.

In Pydantic V1, the decorated function had various attributes added, such as `raw_function`, and `validate` (which could be used to validate arguments without actually calling the decorated function). Due to limited use of these attributes, and performance-oriented changes in implementation, we have not preserved this functionality in `@validate_call`.

### Input types are not preserved[¶](#input-types-are-not-preserved "Permanent link")

In Pydantic V1 we made great efforts to preserve the types of all field inputs for generic collections when they were proper subtypes of the field annotations. For example, given the annotation `Mapping[str, int]` if you passed in a `collection.Counter()` you'd get a `collection.Counter()` as the value.

Supporting this behavior in V2 would have negative performance implications for the general case (we'd have to check types every time) and would add a lot of complexity to validation. Further, even in V1 this behavior was inconsistent and partially broken: it did not work for many types (`str`, `UUID`, etc.), and for generic collections it's impossible to re-build the original input correctly without a lot of special casing (consider `ChainMap`; rebuilding the input is necessary because we need to replace values after validation, e.g. if coercing strings to ints).

In Pydantic V2 we no longer attempt to preserve the input type in all cases; instead, we only promise that the output type will match the type annotations.

Going back to the `Mapping` example, we promise the output will be a valid `Mapping`, and in practice it will be a plain `dict`:

Python 3.9 and abovePython 3.10 and above

`from typing import Mapping  from pydantic import TypeAdapter  class MyDict(dict):     pass  ta = TypeAdapter(Mapping[str, int]) v = ta.validate_python(MyDict()) print(type(v)) #> <class 'dict'>`

`from collections.abc import Mapping  from pydantic import TypeAdapter  class MyDict(dict):     pass  ta = TypeAdapter(Mapping[str, int]) v = ta.validate_python(MyDict()) print(type(v)) #> <class 'dict'>`

If you want the output type to be a specific type, consider annotating it as such or implementing a custom validator:

Python 3.9 and abovePython 3.10 and above

`from typing import Annotated, Any, Mapping, TypeVar  from pydantic import (     TypeAdapter,     ValidationInfo,     ValidatorFunctionWrapHandler,     WrapValidator, )  def restore_input_type(     value: Any, handler: ValidatorFunctionWrapHandler, _info: ValidationInfo ) -> Any:     return type(value)(handler(value))  T = TypeVar('T') PreserveType = Annotated[T, WrapValidator(restore_input_type)]  ta = TypeAdapter(PreserveType[Mapping[str, int]])  class MyDict(dict):     pass  v = ta.validate_python(MyDict()) assert type(v) is MyDict`

`from typing import Annotated, Any, TypeVar from collections.abc import Mapping  from pydantic import (     TypeAdapter,     ValidationInfo,     ValidatorFunctionWrapHandler,     WrapValidator, )  def restore_input_type(     value: Any, handler: ValidatorFunctionWrapHandler, _info: ValidationInfo ) -> Any:     return type(value)(handler(value))  T = TypeVar('T') PreserveType = Annotated[T, WrapValidator(restore_input_type)]  ta = TypeAdapter(PreserveType[Mapping[str, int]])  class MyDict(dict):     pass  v = ta.validate_python(MyDict()) assert type(v) is MyDict`

While we don't promise to preserve input types everywhere, we _do_ preserve them for subclasses of `BaseModel`, and for dataclasses:

`import pydantic.dataclasses from pydantic import BaseModel  class InnerModel(BaseModel):     x: int  class OuterModel(BaseModel):     inner: InnerModel  class SubInnerModel(InnerModel):     y: int  m = OuterModel(inner=SubInnerModel(x=1, y=2)) print(m) #> inner=SubInnerModel(x=1, y=2)  @pydantic.dataclasses.dataclass class InnerDataclass:     x: int  @pydantic.dataclasses.dataclass class SubInnerDataclass(InnerDataclass):     y: int  @pydantic.dataclasses.dataclass class OuterDataclass:     inner: InnerDataclass  d = OuterDataclass(inner=SubInnerDataclass(x=1, y=2)) print(d) #> OuterDataclass(inner=SubInnerDataclass(x=1, y=2))`

### Changes to Handling of Standard Types[¶](#changes-to-handling-of-standard-types "Permanent link")

#### Dicts[¶](#dicts "Permanent link")

Iterables of pairs (which include empty iterables) no longer pass validation for fields of type `dict`.

#### Unions[¶](#unions "Permanent link")

While union types will still attempt validation of each choice from left to right, they now preserve the type of the input whenever possible, even if the correct type is not the first choice for which the input would pass validation. As a demonstration, consider the following example:

Python 3.9 and abovePython 3.10 and above

`from typing import Union  from pydantic import BaseModel  class Model(BaseModel):     x: Union[int, str]  print(Model(x='1')) #> x='1'`

`from pydantic import BaseModel  class Model(BaseModel):     x: int | str  print(Model(x='1')) #> x='1'`

In Pydantic V1, the printed result would have been `x=1`, since the value would pass validation as an `int`. In Pydantic V2, we recognize that the value is an instance of one of the cases and short-circuit the standard union validation.

To revert to the non-short-circuiting left-to-right behavior of V1, annotate the union with `Field(union_mode='left_to_right')`. See [Union Mode](../concepts/unions/#union-modes)
 for more details.

#### Required, optional, and nullable fields[¶](#required-optional-and-nullable-fields "Permanent link")

Pydantic V2 changes some of the logic for specifying whether a field annotated as `Optional` is required (i.e., has no default value) or not (i.e., has a default value of `None` or any other value of the corresponding type), and now more closely matches the behavior of `dataclasses`. Similarly, fields annotated as `Any` no longer have a default value of `None`.

The following table describes the behavior of field annotations in V2:

| State | Field Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Required, cannot be `None` | `f1: str` |
| Not required, cannot be `None`, is `'abc'` by default | `f2: str = 'abc'` |
| Required, can be `None` | `f3: Optional[str]` |
| Not required, can be `None`, is `None` by default | `f4: Optional[str] = None` |
| Not required, can be `None`, is `'abc'` by default | `f5: Optional[str] = 'abc'` |
| Required, can be any type (including `None`) | `f6: Any` |
| Not required, can be any type (including `None`) | `f7: Any = None` |

Note

A field annotated as `typing.Optional[T]` will be required, and will allow for a value of `None`. It does not mean that the field has a default value of `None`. _(This is a breaking change from V1.)_

Note

Any default value if provided makes a field not required.

Here is a code example demonstrating the above:

Python 3.9 and abovePython 3.10 and above

`from typing import Optional  from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError  class Foo(BaseModel):     f1: str  # required, cannot be None     f2: Optional[str]  # required, can be None - same as str | None     f3: Optional[str] = None  # not required, can be None     f4: str = 'Foobar'  # not required, but cannot be None  try:     Foo(f1=None, f2=None, f4='b') except ValidationError as e:     print(e)     """     1 validation error for Foo     f1       Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=None, input_type=NoneType]     """`

`from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError  class Foo(BaseModel):     f1: str  # required, cannot be None     f2: str | None  # required, can be None - same as str | None     f3: str | None = None  # not required, can be None     f4: str = 'Foobar'  # not required, but cannot be None  try:     Foo(f1=None, f2=None, f4='b') except ValidationError as e:     print(e)     """     1 validation error for Foo     f1       Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=None, input_type=NoneType]     """`

#### Patterns / regex on strings[¶](#patterns-regex-on-strings "Permanent link")

Pydantic V1 used Python's regex library. Pydantic V2 uses the Rust [regex crate](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex)
. This crate is not just a "Rust version of regular expressions", it's a completely different approach to regular expressions. In particular, it promises linear time searching of strings in exchange for dropping a couple of features (namely look arounds and backreferences). We believe this is a tradeoff worth making, in particular because Pydantic is used to validate untrusted input where ensuring things don't accidentally run in exponential time depending on the untrusted input is important. On the flipside, for anyone not using these features complex regex validation should be orders of magnitude faster because it's done in Rust and in linear time.

If you still want to use Python's regex library, you can use the [`regex_engine`](../api/config/#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.regex_engine)
 config setting.

### Type conversion from floats to integers[¶](#type-conversion-from-floats-to-integers "Permanent link")

In V1, whenever a field was annotated as `int`, any float value would be accepted, which could lead to a potential data loss if the float value contains a non-zero decimal part. In V2, type conversion from floats to integers is only allowed if the decimal part is zero:

`from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError  class Model(BaseModel):     x: int  print(Model(x=10.0)) #> x=10 try:     Model(x=10.2) except ValidationError as err:     print(err)     """     1 validation error for Model     x       Input should be a valid integer, got a number with a fractional part [type=int_from_float, input_value=10.2, input_type=float]     """`

### Introduction of `TypeAdapter`[¶](#introduction-of-typeadapter "Permanent link")

Pydantic V1 had weak support for validating or serializing non-`BaseModel` types.

To work with them, you had to either create a "root" model or use the utility functions in `pydantic.tools` (namely, `parse_obj_as` and `schema_of`).

In Pydantic V2 this is _a lot_ easier: the [`TypeAdapter`](../api/type_adapter/#pydantic.type_adapter.TypeAdapter)
 class lets you create an object with methods for validating, serializing, and producing JSON schemas for arbitrary types. This serves as a complete replacement for `parse_obj_as` and `schema_of` (which are now deprecated), and also covers some of the use cases of "root" models. ([`RootModel`](../concepts/models/#rootmodel-and-custom-root-types)
, [discussed above](#changes-to-pydanticbasemodel)
, covers the others.)

`from pydantic import TypeAdapter  adapter = TypeAdapter(list[int]) assert adapter.validate_python(['1', '2', '3']) == [1, 2, 3] print(adapter.json_schema()) #> {'items': {'type': 'integer'}, 'type': 'array'}`

Due to limitations of inferring generic types with common type checkers, to get proper typing in some scenarios, you may need to explicitly specify the generic parameter:

`from pydantic import TypeAdapter  adapter = TypeAdapter[str | int](str | int) ...`

See [Type Adapter](../concepts/type_adapter/)
 for more information.

### Defining custom types[¶](#defining-custom-types "Permanent link")

We have completely overhauled the way custom types are defined in pydantic.

We have exposed hooks for generating both `pydantic-core` and JSON schemas, allowing you to get all the performance benefits of Pydantic V2 even when using your own custom types.

We have also introduced ways to use [`typing.Annotated`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Annotated)
 to add custom validation to your own types.

The main changes are:

*   `__get_validators__` should be replaced with `__get_pydantic_core_schema__`. See [Custom Data Types](../concepts/types/#customizing_validation_with_get_pydantic_core_schema)
     for more information.
*   `__modify_schema__` becomes `__get_pydantic_json_schema__`. See [JSON Schema Customization](../concepts/json_schema/#customizing-json-schema)
     for more information.

Additionally, you can use [`typing.Annotated`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Annotated)
 to modify or provide the `__get_pydantic_core_schema__` and `__get_pydantic_json_schema__` functions of a type by annotating it, rather than modifying the type itself. This provides a powerful and flexible mechanism for integrating third-party types with Pydantic, and in some cases may help you remove hacks from Pydantic V1 introduced to work around the limitations for custom types.

See [Custom Data Types](../concepts/types/#custom-types)
 for more information.

### Changes to JSON schema generation[¶](#changes-to-json-schema-generation "Permanent link")

We received many requests over the years to make changes to the JSON schemas that pydantic generates.

In Pydantic V2, we have tried to address many of the common requests:

*   The JSON schema for `Optional` fields now indicates that the value `null` is allowed.
*   The `Decimal` type is now exposed in JSON schema (and serialized) as a string.
*   The JSON schema no longer preserves namedtuples as namedtuples.
*   The JSON schema we generate by default now targets draft 2020-12 (with some OpenAPI extensions).
*   When they differ, you can now specify if you want the JSON schema representing the inputs to validation, or the outputs from serialization.

However, there have been many reasonable requests over the years for changes which we have not chosen to implement.

In Pydantic V1, even if you were willing to implement changes yourself, it was very difficult because the JSON schema generation process involved various recursive function calls; to override one, you'd have to copy and modify the whole implementation.

In Pydantic V2, one of our design goals was to make it easier to customize JSON schema generation. To this end, we have introduced the class [`GenerateJsonSchema`](../api/json_schema/#pydantic.json_schema.GenerateJsonSchema)
, which implements the translation of a type's pydantic-core schema into a JSON schema. By design, this class breaks the JSON schema generation process into smaller methods that can be easily overridden in subclasses to modify the "global" approach to generating JSON schema.

The various methods that can be used to produce JSON schema (such as `BaseModel.model_json_schema` or `TypeAdapter.json_schema`) accept a keyword argument `schema_generator: type[GenerateJsonSchema] = GenerateJsonSchema`, and you can pass your custom subclass to these methods in order to use your own approach to generating JSON schema.

Hopefully this means that if you disagree with any of the choices we've made, or if you are reliant on behaviors in Pydantic V1 that have changed in Pydantic V2, you can use a custom `schema_generator`, modifying the `GenerateJsonSchema` class as necessary for your application.

### `BaseSettings` has moved to `pydantic-settings`[¶](#basesettings-has-moved-to-pydantic-settings "Permanent link")

[`BaseSettings`](../api/pydantic_settings/#pydantic_settings.BaseSettings)
, the base object for Pydantic [settings management](../concepts/pydantic_settings/)
, has been moved to a separate package, [`pydantic-settings`](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-settings)
.

Also, the `parse_env_var` classmethod has been removed. So, you need to [customise settings sources](../concepts/pydantic_settings/#customise-settings-sources)
 to have your own parsing function.

### Color and Payment Card Numbers moved to `pydantic-extra-types`[¶](#color-and-payment-card-numbers-moved-to-pydantic-extra-types "Permanent link")

The following special-use types have been moved to the [Pydantic Extra Types](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-extra-types)
 package, which may be installed separately if needed.

*   [Color Types](../api/pydantic_extra_types_color/)
    
*   [Payment Card Numbers](../api/pydantic_extra_types_payment/)
    

### Url and Dsn types in `pydantic.networks` no longer inherit from `str`[¶](#url-and-dsn-types-in-pydanticnetworks-no-longer-inherit-from-str "Permanent link")

In Pydantic V1 the [`AnyUrl`](../api/networks/#pydantic.networks.AnyUrl)
 type inherited from `str`, and all the other `Url` and `Dsn` types inherited from these. In Pydantic V2 these types are built on two new `Url` and `MultiHostUrl` classes using `Annotated`.

Inheriting from `str` had upsides and downsides, and for V2 we decided it would be better to remove this. To use these types in APIs which expect `str` you'll now need to convert them (with `str(url)`).

Pydantic V2 uses Rust's [Url](https://crates.io/crates/url)
 crate for URL validation. Some of the URL validation differs slightly from the previous behavior in V1. One notable difference is that the new `Url` types append slashes to the validated version if no path is included, even if a slash is not specified in the argument to a `Url` type constructor. See the example below for this behavior:

`from pydantic import AnyUrl  assert str(AnyUrl(url='https://google.com')) == 'https://google.com/' assert str(AnyUrl(url='https://google.com/')) == 'https://google.com/' assert str(AnyUrl(url='https://google.com/api')) == 'https://google.com/api' assert str(AnyUrl(url='https://google.com/api/')) == 'https://google.com/api/'`

If you still want to use the old behavior without the appended slash, take a look at this [solution](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/7186#issuecomment-1690235887)
.

### Constrained types[¶](#constrained-types "Permanent link")

The `Constrained*` classes were _removed_, and you should replace them by `Annotated[<type>, Field(...)]`, for example:

`from pydantic import BaseModel, ConstrainedInt  class MyInt(ConstrainedInt):     ge = 0  class Model(BaseModel):     x: MyInt`

...becomes:

`from typing import Annotated  from pydantic import BaseModel, Field  MyInt = Annotated[int, Field(ge=0)]  class Model(BaseModel):     x: MyInt`

Read more about it in the [Composing types via `Annotated`](../concepts/types/#using-the-annotated-pattern)
 docs.

For `ConstrainedStr` you can use [`StringConstraints`](../api/types/#pydantic.types.StringConstraints)
 instead.

### Mypy plugins[¶](#mypy-plugins "Permanent link")

Pydantic V2 contains a [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extending_mypy.html#configuring-mypy-to-use-plugins)
 plugin in `pydantic.mypy`.

When using [V1 features](./#continue-using-pydantic-v1-features)
 the `pydantic.v1.mypy` plugin might need to also be enabled.

To configure the mypy plugins:

`mypy.ini``pyproject.toml`

``[mypy] plugins = pydantic.mypy, pydantic.v1.mypy  # include `.v1.mypy` if required.``

``[tool.mypy] plugins = [     "pydantic.mypy",     "pydantic.v1.mypy",  # include `.v1.mypy` if required. ]``

Other changes[¶](#other-changes "Permanent link")

--------------------------------------------------

*   Dropped support for [`email-validator<2.0.0`](https://github.com/JoshData/python-email-validator)
    . Make sure to update using `pip install -U email-validator`.

# Version Policy - Pydantic

 



Version Policy
==============

First of all, we recognize that the transitions from Pydantic V1 to V2 has been and will be painful for some users. We're sorry about this pain ![🙏](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0/assets/svg/1f64f.svg ":pray:"), it was an unfortunate but necessary step to correct design mistakes of V1.

**There will not be another breaking change of this magnitude!**

Pydantic V1[¶](#pydantic-v1 "Permanent link")

----------------------------------------------

Active development of V1 has already stopped, however critical bug fixes and security vulnerabilities will be fixed in V1 until the release of Pydantic V3.

Pydantic V2[¶](#pydantic-v2 "Permanent link")

----------------------------------------------

We will not intentionally make breaking changes in minor releases of V2.

Functionality marked as deprecated will not be removed until the next major V3 release.

Of course, some apparently safe changes and bug fixes will inevitably break some users' code — obligatory link to [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1172/)
.

The following changes will **NOT** be considered breaking changes, and may occur in minor releases:

*   Changing the format of JSON Schema [references](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/structuring#dollarref)
    .
*   Changing the `msg`, `ctx`, and `loc` fields of [`ValidationError`](../api/pydantic_core/#pydantic_core.ValidationError)
     exceptions. `type` will not change — if you're programmatically parsing error messages, you should use `type`.
*   Adding new keys to [`ValidationError`](../api/pydantic_core/#pydantic_core.ValidationError)
     exceptions — e.g. we intend to add `line_number` and `column_number` to errors when validating JSON once we migrate to a new JSON parser.
*   Adding new [`ValidationError`](../api/pydantic_core/#pydantic_core.ValidationError)
     errors.
*   Changing how `__repr__` behaves, even of public classes.

In all cases we will aim to minimize churn and do so only when justified by the increase of quality of Pydantic for users.

Pydantic V3 and beyond[¶](#pydantic-v3-and-beyond "Permanent link")

--------------------------------------------------------------------

We expect to make new major releases roughly once a year going forward, although as mentioned above, any associated breaking changes should be trivial to fix compared to the V1-to-V2 transition.

Experimental Features[¶](#experimental-features "Permanent link")

------------------------------------------------------------------

At Pydantic, we like to move quickly and innovate! To that end, we may introduce experimental features in minor releases.

Usage Documentation

To learn more about our current experimental features, see the [experimental features documentation](../concepts/experimental/)
.

Please keep in mind, experimental features are active works in progress. If these features are successful, they'll eventually become part of Pydantic. If unsuccessful, said features will be removed with little notice. While in its experimental phase, a feature's API and behaviors may not be stable, and it's very possible that changes made to the feature will not be backward-compatible.

### Naming Conventions[¶](#naming-conventions "Permanent link")

We use one of the following naming conventions to indicate that a feature is experimental:

1.  The feature is located in the [`experimental`](../api/experimental/)
     module. In this case, you can access the feature like this:
    
    `from pydantic.experimental import feature_name`
    
2.  The feature is located in the main module, but prefixed with `experimental_`. This case occurs when we add a new field, argument, or method to an existing data structure already within the main `pydantic` module.
    

New features with these naming conventions are subject to change or removal, and we are looking for feedback and suggestions before making them a permanent part of Pydantic. See the [feedback section](../concepts/experimental/#feedback)
 for more information.

### Importing Experimental Features[¶](#importing-experimental-features "Permanent link")

When you import an experimental feature from the [`experimental`](../api/experimental/)
 module, you'll see a warning message that the feature is experimental. You can disable this warning with the following:

`import warnings  from pydantic import PydanticExperimentalWarning  warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=PydanticExperimentalWarning)`

### Lifecycle of Experimental Features[¶](#lifecycle-of-experimental-features "Permanent link")

1.  A new feature is added, either in the [`experimental`](../api/experimental/)
     module or with the `experimental_` prefix.
2.  The behavior is often modified during patch/minor releases, with potential API/behavior changes.
3.  If the feature is successful, we promote it to Pydantic with the following steps:
    
    a. If it was in the [`experimental`](../api/experimental/)
     module, the feature is cloned to Pydantic's main module. The original experimental feature still remains in the [`experimental`](../api/experimental/)
     module, but it will show a warning when used. If the feature was already in the main Pydantic module, we create a copy of the feature without the `experimental_` prefix, so the feature exists with both the official and experimental names. A deprecation warning is attached to the experimental version.
    
    b. At some point, the code of the experimental feature is removed, but there will still be a stub of the feature that provides an error message with appropriate instructions.
    
    c. As a last step, the experimental version of the feature is entirely removed from the codebase.
    

If the feature is unsuccessful or unpopular, it's removed with little notice. A stub will remain in the location of the deprecated feature with an error message.

Thanks to [streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/quick-reference/prerelease)
 for the inspiration for the lifecycle and naming conventions of our new experimental feature patterns.

Support for Python versions[¶](#support-for-python-versions "Permanent link")

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pydantic will drop support for a Python version when the following conditions are met:

*   The Python version has reached its [expected end of life](https://devguide.python.org/versions/)
    .
*   less than 5% of downloads of the most recent minor release are using that version.

# Why use Pydantic - Pydantic

 



Why use Pydantic?[¶](#why-use-pydantic "Permanent link")

=========================================================

Today, Pydantic is downloaded many times a month and used by some of the largest and most recognisable organisations in the world.

It's hard to know why so many people have adopted Pydantic since its inception six years ago, but here are a few guesses.

Type hints powering schema validation[¶](#type-hints "Permanent link")

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The schema that Pydantic validates against is generally defined by Python [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-type-hint)
.

Type hints are great for this since, if you're writing modern Python, you already know how to use them. Using type hints also means that Pydantic integrates well with static typing tools (like [mypy](https://www.mypy-lang.org/)
 and [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/)
) and IDEs (like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
 and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
).

Example - just type hints

`from typing import Annotated, Literal  from annotated_types import Gt  from pydantic import BaseModel  class Fruit(BaseModel):     name: str  # (1)!     color: Literal['red', 'green']  # (2)!     weight: Annotated[float, Gt(0)]  # (3)!     bazam: dict[str, list[tuple[int, bool, float]]]  # (4)!  print(     Fruit(         name='Apple',         color='red',         weight=4.2,         bazam={'foobar': [(1, True, 0.1)]},     ) ) #> name='Apple' color='red' weight=4.2 bazam={'foobar': [(1, True, 0.1)]}`

1.  The `name` field is simply annotated with `str` — any string is allowed.
2.  The [`Literal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Literal)
     type is used to enforce that `color` is either `'red'` or `'green'`.
3.  Even when we want to apply constraints not encapsulated in Python types, we can use [`Annotated`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Annotated)
     and [`annotated-types`](https://github.com/annotated-types/annotated-types)
     to enforce constraints while still keeping typing support.
4.  I'm not claiming "bazam" is really an attribute of fruit, but rather to show that arbitrarily complex types can easily be validated.

Performance[¶](#performance "Permanent link")

----------------------------------------------

Pydantic's core validation logic is implemented in a separate package ([`pydantic-core`](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core)
), where validation for most types is implemented in Rust.

As a result, Pydantic is among the fastest data validation libraries for Python.

Performance Example - Pydantic vs. dedicated code

In general, dedicated code should be much faster than a general-purpose validator, but in this example Pydantic is >300% faster than dedicated code when parsing JSON and validating URLs.

Performance Example

`import json import timeit from urllib.parse import urlparse  import requests  from pydantic import HttpUrl, TypeAdapter  reps = 7 number = 100 r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/emojis') r.raise_for_status() emojis_json = r.content  def emojis_pure_python(raw_data):     data = json.loads(raw_data)     output = {}     for key, value in data.items():         assert isinstance(key, str)         url = urlparse(value)         assert url.scheme in ('https', 'http')         output[key] = url  emojis_pure_python_times = timeit.repeat(     'emojis_pure_python(emojis_json)',     globals={         'emojis_pure_python': emojis_pure_python,         'emojis_json': emojis_json,     },     repeat=reps,     number=number, ) print(f'pure python: {min(emojis_pure_python_times) / number * 1000:0.2f}ms') #> pure python: 5.32ms  type_adapter = TypeAdapter(dict[str, HttpUrl]) emojis_pydantic_times = timeit.repeat(     'type_adapter.validate_json(emojis_json)',     globals={         'type_adapter': type_adapter,         'HttpUrl': HttpUrl,         'emojis_json': emojis_json,     },     repeat=reps,     number=number, ) print(f'pydantic: {min(emojis_pydantic_times) / number * 1000:0.2f}ms') #> pydantic: 1.54ms  print(     f'Pydantic {min(emojis_pure_python_times) / min(emojis_pydantic_times):0.2f}x faster' ) #> Pydantic 3.45x faster`

Unlike other performance-centric libraries written in compiled languages, Pydantic also has excellent support for customizing validation via [functional validators](#customisation)
.

Samuel Colvin's [talk at PyCon 2023](https://youtu.be/pWZw7hYoRVU)
 explains how [`pydantic-core`](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core)
 works and how it integrates with Pydantic.

Serialization[¶](#serialization "Permanent link")

--------------------------------------------------

Pydantic provides functionality to serialize model in three ways:

1.  To a Python `dict` made up of the associated Python objects.
2.  To a Python `dict` made up only of "jsonable" types.
3.  To a JSON string.

In all three modes, the output can be customized by excluding specific fields, excluding unset fields, excluding default values, and excluding `None` values.

Example - Serialization 3 ways

`from datetime import datetime  from pydantic import BaseModel  class Meeting(BaseModel):     when: datetime     where: bytes     why: str = 'No idea'  m = Meeting(when='2020-01-01T12:00', where='home') print(m.model_dump(exclude_unset=True)) #> {'when': datetime.datetime(2020, 1, 1, 12, 0), 'where': b'home'} print(m.model_dump(exclude={'where'}, mode='json')) #> {'when': '2020-01-01T12:00:00', 'why': 'No idea'} print(m.model_dump_json(exclude_defaults=True)) #> {"when":"2020-01-01T12:00:00","where":"home"}`

Learn more

See the [documentation on serialization](../concepts/serialization/)
.

JSON Schema[¶](#json-schema "Permanent link")

----------------------------------------------

A [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/)
 can be generated for any Pydantic schema — allowing self-documenting APIs and integration with a wide variety of tools which support the JSON Schema format.

Example - JSON Schema

`from datetime import datetime  from pydantic import BaseModel  class Address(BaseModel):     street: str     city: str     zipcode: str  class Meeting(BaseModel):     when: datetime     where: Address     why: str = 'No idea'  print(Meeting.model_json_schema()) """ {     '$defs': {         'Address': {             'properties': {                 'street': {'title': 'Street', 'type': 'string'},                 'city': {'title': 'City', 'type': 'string'},                 'zipcode': {'title': 'Zipcode', 'type': 'string'},             },             'required': ['street', 'city', 'zipcode'],             'title': 'Address',             'type': 'object',         }     },     'properties': {         'when': {'format': 'date-time', 'title': 'When', 'type': 'string'},         'where': {'$ref': '#/$defs/Address'},         'why': {'default': 'No idea', 'title': 'Why', 'type': 'string'},     },     'required': ['when', 'where'],     'title': 'Meeting',     'type': 'object', } """`

Pydantic is compliant with the latest version of JSON Schema specification ([2020-12](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/release-notes.html)
), which is compatible with [OpenAPI 3.1](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0.html)
.

Learn more

See the [documentation on JSON Schema](../concepts/json_schema/)
.

Strict mode and data coercion[¶](#strict-lax "Permanent link")

---------------------------------------------------------------

By default, Pydantic is tolerant to common incorrect types and coerces data to the right type — e.g. a numeric string passed to an `int` field will be parsed as an `int`.

Pydantic also has as [strict mode](../concepts/strict_mode/)
, where types are not coerced and a validation error is raised unless the input data exactly matches the expected schema.

But strict mode would be pretty useless when validating JSON data since JSON doesn't have types matching many common Python types like [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime)
, [`UUID`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html#uuid.UUID)
 or [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes)
.

To solve this, Pydantic can parse and validate JSON in one step. This allows sensible data conversion (e.g. when parsing strings into [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime)
 objects). Since the JSON parsing is implemented in Rust, it's also very performant.

Example - Strict mode that's actually useful

`from datetime import datetime  from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError  class Meeting(BaseModel):     when: datetime     where: bytes  m = Meeting.model_validate({'when': '2020-01-01T12:00', 'where': 'home'}) print(m) #> when=datetime.datetime(2020, 1, 1, 12, 0) where=b'home' try:     m = Meeting.model_validate(         {'when': '2020-01-01T12:00', 'where': 'home'}, strict=True     ) except ValidationError as e:     print(e)     """     2 validation errors for Meeting     when       Input should be a valid datetime [type=datetime_type, input_value='2020-01-01T12:00', input_type=str]     where       Input should be a valid bytes [type=bytes_type, input_value='home', input_type=str]     """  m_json = Meeting.model_validate_json(     '{"when": "2020-01-01T12:00", "where": "home"}' ) print(m_json) #> when=datetime.datetime(2020, 1, 1, 12, 0) where=b'home'`

.

Dataclasses, TypedDicts, and more[¶](#dataclasses-typeddict-more "Permanent link")

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pydantic provides four ways to create schemas and perform validation and serialization:

1.  [`BaseModel`](../concepts/models/)
     — Pydantic's own super class with many common utilities available via instance methods.
2.  [Pydantic dataclasses](../concepts/dataclasses/)
     — a wrapper around standard dataclasses with additional validation performed.
3.  [`TypeAdapter`](../api/type_adapter/#pydantic.type_adapter.TypeAdapter)
     — a general way to adapt any type for validation and serialization. This allows types like [`TypedDict`](../api/standard_library_types/#typeddict)
     and [`NamedTuple`](../api/standard_library_types/#typingnamedtuple)
     to be validated as well as simple types (like [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int)
     or [`timedelta`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.timedelta)
    ) — [all types](../concepts/types/)
     supported can be used with [`TypeAdapter`](../api/type_adapter/#pydantic.type_adapter.TypeAdapter)
    .
4.  [`validate_call`](../concepts/validation_decorator/)
     — a decorator to perform validation when calling a function.

Example - schema based on a [`TypedDict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict)

`from datetime import datetime  from typing_extensions import NotRequired, TypedDict  from pydantic import TypeAdapter  class Meeting(TypedDict):     when: datetime     where: bytes     why: NotRequired[str]  meeting_adapter = TypeAdapter(Meeting) m = meeting_adapter.validate_python(  # (1)!     {'when': '2020-01-01T12:00', 'where': 'home'} ) print(m) #> {'when': datetime.datetime(2020, 1, 1, 12, 0), 'where': b'home'} meeting_adapter.dump_python(m, exclude={'where'})  # (2)!  print(meeting_adapter.json_schema())  # (3)! """ {     'properties': {         'when': {'format': 'date-time', 'title': 'When', 'type': 'string'},         'where': {'format': 'binary', 'title': 'Where', 'type': 'string'},         'why': {'title': 'Why', 'type': 'string'},     },     'required': ['when', 'where'],     'title': 'Meeting',     'type': 'object', } """`

1.  [`TypeAdapter`](../api/type_adapter/#pydantic.type_adapter.TypeAdapter)
     for a [`TypedDict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict)
     performing validation, it can also validate JSON data directly with [`validate_json`](../api/type_adapter/#pydantic.type_adapter.TypeAdapter.validate_json)
    .
2.  [`dump_python`](../api/type_adapter/#pydantic.type_adapter.TypeAdapter.dump_python)
     to serialise a [`TypedDict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict)
     to a python object, it can also serialise to JSON with [`dump_json`](../api/type_adapter/#pydantic.type_adapter.TypeAdapter.dump_json)
    .
3.  [`TypeAdapter`](../api/type_adapter/#pydantic.type_adapter.TypeAdapter)
     can also generate a JSON Schema.

Customisation[¶](#customisation "Permanent link")

--------------------------------------------------

Functional validators and serializers, as well as a powerful protocol for custom types, means the way Pydantic operates can be customized on a per-field or per-type basis.

Customisation Example - wrap validators

"wrap validators" are new in Pydantic V2 and are one of the most powerful ways to customize validation.

`from datetime import datetime, timezone from typing import Any  from pydantic_core.core_schema import ValidatorFunctionWrapHandler  from pydantic import BaseModel, field_validator  class Meeting(BaseModel):     when: datetime      @field_validator('when', mode='wrap')     def when_now(         cls, input_value: Any, handler: ValidatorFunctionWrapHandler     ) -> datetime:         if input_value == 'now':             return datetime.now()         when = handler(input_value)         # in this specific application we know tz naive datetimes are in UTC         if when.tzinfo is None:             when = when.replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)         return when  print(Meeting(when='2020-01-01T12:00+01:00')) #> when=datetime.datetime(2020, 1, 1, 12, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(+01:00)) print(Meeting(when='now')) #> when=datetime.datetime(2032, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) print(Meeting(when='2020-01-01T12:00')) #> when=datetime.datetime(2020, 1, 1, 12, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)`

# Configuration - Pydantic

 



Configuration
=============

Configuration for Pydantic models.

ConfigDict [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict "Permanent link")

-------------------------------------------------------------

Bases: `TypedDict`

A TypedDict for configuring Pydantic behaviour.

### title `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.title "Permanent link")

`title: [str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)  | None`

The title for the generated JSON schema, defaults to the model's name

### model\_title\_generator `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.model_title_generator "Permanent link")

`model_title_generator: [Callable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Callable "typing.Callable") [[[type](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-type) ], [str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) ] | None`

A callable that takes a model class and returns the title for it. Defaults to `None`.

### field\_title\_generator `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.field_title_generator "Permanent link")

`field_title_generator: (     [Callable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Callable "typing.Callable") [[[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) , [FieldInfo](../fields/#pydantic.fields.FieldInfo "pydantic.fields.FieldInfo")  | [ComputedFieldInfo](../fields/#pydantic.fields.ComputedFieldInfo "pydantic.fields.ComputedFieldInfo") ], [str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) ]     | None )`

A callable that takes a field's name and info and returns title for it. Defaults to `None`.

### str\_to\_lower `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.str_to_lower "Permanent link")

`str_to_lower: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

Whether to convert all characters to lowercase for str types. Defaults to `False`.

### str\_to\_upper `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.str_to_upper "Permanent link")

`str_to_upper: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

Whether to convert all characters to uppercase for str types. Defaults to `False`.

### str\_strip\_whitespace `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.str_strip_whitespace "Permanent link")

`str_strip_whitespace: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

Whether to strip leading and trailing whitespace for str types.

### str\_min\_length `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.str_min_length "Permanent link")

`str_min_length: [int](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int)`

The minimum length for str types. Defaults to `None`.

### str\_max\_length `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.str_max_length "Permanent link")

`str_max_length: [int](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int)  | None`

The maximum length for str types. Defaults to `None`.

### extra `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.extra "Permanent link")

`extra: [ExtraValues](#pydantic.config.ExtraValues "pydantic.config.ExtraValues")  | None`

Whether to ignore, allow, or forbid extra data during model initialization. Defaults to `'ignore'`.

Three configuration values are available:

*   `'ignore'`: Providing extra data is ignored (the default):
    
    `from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict  class User(BaseModel):     model_config = ConfigDict(extra='ignore')  # (1)!      name: str  user = User(name='John Doe', age=20)  # (2)! print(user) #> name='John Doe'`
    
    1.  This is the default behaviour.
    2.  The `age` argument is ignored.
*   `'forbid'`: Providing extra data is not permitted, and a [`ValidationError`](../pydantic_core/#pydantic_core.ValidationError)
     will be raised if this is the case:
    
    `from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict, ValidationError  class Model(BaseModel):     x: int      model_config = ConfigDict(extra='forbid')  try:     Model(x=1, y='a') except ValidationError as exc:     print(exc)     """     1 validation error for Model     y       Extra inputs are not permitted [type=extra_forbidden, input_value='a', input_type=str]     """`
    
*   `'allow'`: Providing extra data is allowed and stored in the `__pydantic_extra__` dictionary attribute:
    
    `from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict  class Model(BaseModel):     x: int      model_config = ConfigDict(extra='allow')  m = Model(x=1, y='a') assert m.__pydantic_extra__ == {'y': 'a'}`
    
    By default, no validation will be applied to these extra items, but you can set a type for the values by overriding the type annotation for `__pydantic_extra__`:
    
    `from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict, Field, ValidationError  class Model(BaseModel):     __pydantic_extra__: dict[str, int] = Field(init=False)  # (1)!      x: int      model_config = ConfigDict(extra='allow')  try:     Model(x=1, y='a') except ValidationError as exc:     print(exc)     """     1 validation error for Model     y       Input should be a valid integer, unable to parse string as an integer [type=int_parsing, input_value='a', input_type=str]     """  m = Model(x=1, y='2') assert m.x == 1 assert m.y == 2 assert m.model_dump() == {'x': 1, 'y': 2} assert m.__pydantic_extra__ == {'y': 2}`
    
    1.  The `= Field(init=False)` does not have any effect at runtime, but prevents the `__pydantic_extra__` field from being included as a parameter to the model's `__init__` method by type checkers.

### frozen `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.frozen "Permanent link")

`frozen: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

Whether models are faux-immutable, i.e. whether `__setattr__` is allowed, and also generates a `__hash__()` method for the model. This makes instances of the model potentially hashable if all the attributes are hashable. Defaults to `False`.

Note

On V1, the inverse of this setting was called `allow_mutation`, and was `True` by default.

### populate\_by\_name `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.populate_by_name "Permanent link")

`populate_by_name: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

Whether an aliased field may be populated by its name as given by the model attribute, as well as the alias. Defaults to `False`.

Warning

`populate_by_name` usage is not recommended in v2.11+ and will be deprecated in v3. Instead, you should use the [`validate_by_name`](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.validate_by_name)
 configuration setting.

When `validate_by_name=True` and `validate_by_alias=True`, this is strictly equivalent to the previous behavior of `populate_by_name=True`.

In v2.11, we also introduced a [`validate_by_alias`](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.validate_by_alias)
 setting that introduces more fine grained control for validation behavior.

Here's how you might go about using the new settings to achieve the same behavior:

`from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict, Field  class Model(BaseModel):     model_config = ConfigDict(validate_by_name=True, validate_by_alias=True)      my_field: str = Field(alias='my_alias')  # (1)!  m = Model(my_alias='foo')  # (2)! print(m) #> my_field='foo'  m = Model(my_alias='foo')  # (3)! print(m) #> my_field='foo'`

1.  The field `'my_field'` has an alias `'my_alias'`.
2.  The model is populated by the alias `'my_alias'`.
3.  The model is populated by the attribute name `'my_field'`.

### use\_enum\_values `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.use_enum_values "Permanent link")

`use_enum_values: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

Whether to populate models with the `value` property of enums, rather than the raw enum. This may be useful if you want to serialize `model.model_dump()` later. Defaults to `False`.

Note

If you have an `Optional[Enum]` value that you set a default for, you need to use `validate_default=True` for said Field to ensure that the `use_enum_values` flag takes effect on the default, as extracting an enum's value occurs during validation, not serialization.

`from enum import Enum from typing import Optional  from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict, Field  class SomeEnum(Enum):     FOO = 'foo'     BAR = 'bar'     BAZ = 'baz'  class SomeModel(BaseModel):     model_config = ConfigDict(use_enum_values=True)      some_enum: SomeEnum     another_enum: Optional[SomeEnum] = Field(         default=SomeEnum.FOO, validate_default=True     )  model1 = SomeModel(some_enum=SomeEnum.BAR) print(model1.model_dump()) #> {'some_enum': 'bar', 'another_enum': 'foo'}  model2 = SomeModel(some_enum=SomeEnum.BAR, another_enum=SomeEnum.BAZ) print(model2.model_dump()) #> {'some_enum': 'bar', 'another_enum': 'baz'}`

### validate\_assignment `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.validate_assignment "Permanent link")

`validate_assignment: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

Whether to validate the data when the model is changed. Defaults to `False`.

The default behavior of Pydantic is to validate the data when the model is created.

In case the user changes the data after the model is created, the model is _not_ revalidated.

`from pydantic import BaseModel  class User(BaseModel):     name: str  user = User(name='John Doe')  # (1)! print(user) #> name='John Doe' user.name = 123  # (1)! print(user) #> name=123`

1.  The validation happens only when the model is created.
2.  The validation does not happen when the data is changed.

In case you want to revalidate the model when the data is changed, you can use `validate_assignment=True`:

`from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError  class User(BaseModel, validate_assignment=True):  # (1)!     name: str  user = User(name='John Doe')  # (2)! print(user) #> name='John Doe' try:     user.name = 123  # (3)! except ValidationError as e:     print(e)     '''     1 validation error for User     name       Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=123, input_type=int]     '''`

1.  You can either use class keyword arguments, or `model_config` to set `validate_assignment=True`.
2.  The validation happens when the model is created.
3.  The validation _also_ happens when the data is changed.

### arbitrary\_types\_allowed `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.arbitrary_types_allowed "Permanent link")

`arbitrary_types_allowed: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

Whether arbitrary types are allowed for field types. Defaults to `False`.

`from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict, ValidationError  # This is not a pydantic model, it's an arbitrary class class Pet:     def __init__(self, name: str):         self.name = name  class Model(BaseModel):     model_config = ConfigDict(arbitrary_types_allowed=True)      pet: Pet     owner: str  pet = Pet(name='Hedwig') # A simple check of instance type is used to validate the data model = Model(owner='Harry', pet=pet) print(model) #> pet=<__main__.Pet object at 0x0123456789ab> owner='Harry' print(model.pet) #> <__main__.Pet object at 0x0123456789ab> print(model.pet.name) #> Hedwig print(type(model.pet)) #> <class '__main__.Pet'> try:     # If the value is not an instance of the type, it's invalid     Model(owner='Harry', pet='Hedwig') except ValidationError as e:     print(e)     '''     1 validation error for Model     pet       Input should be an instance of Pet [type=is_instance_of, input_value='Hedwig', input_type=str]     '''  # Nothing in the instance of the arbitrary type is checked # Here name probably should have been a str, but it's not validated pet2 = Pet(name=42) model2 = Model(owner='Harry', pet=pet2) print(model2) #> pet=<__main__.Pet object at 0x0123456789ab> owner='Harry' print(model2.pet) #> <__main__.Pet object at 0x0123456789ab> print(model2.pet.name) #> 42 print(type(model2.pet)) #> <class '__main__.Pet'>`

### from\_attributes `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.from_attributes "Permanent link")

`from_attributes: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

Whether to build models and look up discriminators of tagged unions using python object attributes.

### loc\_by\_alias `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.loc_by_alias "Permanent link")

`loc_by_alias: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

Whether to use the actual key provided in the data (e.g. alias) for error `loc`s rather than the field's name. Defaults to `True`.

### alias\_generator `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.alias_generator "Permanent link")

`alias_generator: (     [Callable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Callable "typing.Callable") [[[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) ], [str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) ] | [AliasGenerator](../aliases/#pydantic.aliases.AliasGenerator "pydantic.aliases.AliasGenerator")  | None )`

A callable that takes a field name and returns an alias for it or an instance of [`AliasGenerator`](../aliases/#pydantic.aliases.AliasGenerator)
. Defaults to `None`.

When using a callable, the alias generator is used for both validation and serialization. If you want to use different alias generators for validation and serialization, you can use [`AliasGenerator`](../aliases/#pydantic.aliases.AliasGenerator)
 instead.

If data source field names do not match your code style (e. g. CamelCase fields), you can automatically generate aliases using `alias_generator`. Here's an example with a basic callable:

`from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict from pydantic.alias_generators import to_pascal  class Voice(BaseModel):     model_config = ConfigDict(alias_generator=to_pascal)      name: str     language_code: str  voice = Voice(Name='Filiz', LanguageCode='tr-TR') print(voice.language_code) #> tr-TR print(voice.model_dump(by_alias=True)) #> {'Name': 'Filiz', 'LanguageCode': 'tr-TR'}`

If you want to use different alias generators for validation and serialization, you can use [`AliasGenerator`](../aliases/#pydantic.aliases.AliasGenerator)
.

`from pydantic import AliasGenerator, BaseModel, ConfigDict from pydantic.alias_generators import to_camel, to_pascal  class Athlete(BaseModel):     first_name: str     last_name: str     sport: str      model_config = ConfigDict(         alias_generator=AliasGenerator(             validation_alias=to_camel,             serialization_alias=to_pascal,         )     )  athlete = Athlete(firstName='John', lastName='Doe', sport='track') print(athlete.model_dump(by_alias=True)) #> {'FirstName': 'John', 'LastName': 'Doe', 'Sport': 'track'}`

Note

Pydantic offers three built-in alias generators: [`to_pascal`](#pydantic.alias_generators.to_pascal)
, [`to_camel`](#pydantic.alias_generators.to_camel)
, and [`to_snake`](#pydantic.alias_generators.to_snake)
.

### ignored\_types `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.ignored_types "Permanent link")

`ignored_types: [tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple) [[type](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-type) , ...]`

A tuple of types that may occur as values of class attributes without annotations. This is typically used for custom descriptors (classes that behave like `property`). If an attribute is set on a class without an annotation and has a type that is not in this tuple (or otherwise recognized by _pydantic_), an error will be raised. Defaults to `()`.

### allow\_inf\_nan `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.allow_inf_nan "Permanent link")

`allow_inf_nan: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

Whether to allow infinity (`+inf` an `-inf`) and NaN values to float and decimal fields. Defaults to `True`.

### json\_schema\_extra `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.json_schema_extra "Permanent link")

`json_schema_extra: JsonDict | JsonSchemaExtraCallable | None`

A dict or callable to provide extra JSON schema properties. Defaults to `None`.

### json\_encoders `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.json_encoders "Permanent link")

`json_encoders: [dict](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#dict) [[type](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-type) [[object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-object) ], JsonEncoder] | None`

A `dict` of custom JSON encoders for specific types. Defaults to `None`.

Deprecated

This config option is a carryover from v1. We originally planned to remove it in v2 but didn't have a 1:1 replacement so we are keeping it for now. It is still deprecated and will likely be removed in the future.

### strict `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.strict "Permanent link")

`strict: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

_(new in V2)_ If `True`, strict validation is applied to all fields on the model.

By default, Pydantic attempts to coerce values to the correct type, when possible.

There are situations in which you may want to disable this behavior, and instead raise an error if a value's type does not match the field's type annotation.

To configure strict mode for all fields on a model, you can set `strict=True` on the model.

`from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict  class Model(BaseModel):     model_config = ConfigDict(strict=True)      name: str     age: int`

See [Strict Mode](../../concepts/strict_mode/)
 for more details.

See the [Conversion Table](../../concepts/conversion_table/)
 for more details on how Pydantic converts data in both strict and lax modes.

### revalidate\_instances `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.revalidate_instances "Permanent link")

`revalidate_instances: [Literal](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Literal "typing.Literal") [     "always", "never", "subclass-instances" ]`

When and how to revalidate models and dataclasses during validation. Accepts the string values of `'never'`, `'always'` and `'subclass-instances'`. Defaults to `'never'`.

*   `'never'` will not revalidate models and dataclasses during validation
*   `'always'` will revalidate models and dataclasses during validation
*   `'subclass-instances'` will revalidate models and dataclasses during validation if the instance is a subclass of the model or dataclass

By default, model and dataclass instances are not revalidated during validation.

`from pydantic import BaseModel  class User(BaseModel, revalidate_instances='never'):  # (1)!     hobbies: list[str]  class SubUser(User):     sins: list[str]  class Transaction(BaseModel):     user: User  my_user = User(hobbies=['reading']) t = Transaction(user=my_user) print(t) #> user=User(hobbies=['reading'])  my_user.hobbies = [1]  # (2)! t = Transaction(user=my_user)  # (3)! print(t) #> user=User(hobbies=[1])  my_sub_user = SubUser(hobbies=['scuba diving'], sins=['lying']) t = Transaction(user=my_sub_user) print(t) #> user=SubUser(hobbies=['scuba diving'], sins=['lying'])`

1.  `revalidate_instances` is set to `'never'` by \*\*default.
2.  The assignment is not validated, unless you set `validate_assignment` to `True` in the model's config.
3.  Since `revalidate_instances` is set to `never`, this is not revalidated.

If you want to revalidate instances during validation, you can set `revalidate_instances` to `'always'` in the model's config.

`from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError  class User(BaseModel, revalidate_instances='always'):  # (1)!     hobbies: list[str]  class SubUser(User):     sins: list[str]  class Transaction(BaseModel):     user: User  my_user = User(hobbies=['reading']) t = Transaction(user=my_user) print(t) #> user=User(hobbies=['reading'])  my_user.hobbies = [1] try:     t = Transaction(user=my_user)  # (2)! except ValidationError as e:     print(e)     '''     1 validation error for Transaction     user.hobbies.0       Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=1, input_type=int]     '''  my_sub_user = SubUser(hobbies=['scuba diving'], sins=['lying']) t = Transaction(user=my_sub_user) print(t)  # (3)! #> user=User(hobbies=['scuba diving'])`

1.  `revalidate_instances` is set to `'always'`.
2.  The model is revalidated, since `revalidate_instances` is set to `'always'`.
3.  Using `'never'` we would have gotten `user=SubUser(hobbies=['scuba diving'], sins=['lying'])`.

It's also possible to set `revalidate_instances` to `'subclass-instances'` to only revalidate instances of subclasses of the model.

`from pydantic import BaseModel  class User(BaseModel, revalidate_instances='subclass-instances'):  # (1)!     hobbies: list[str]  class SubUser(User):     sins: list[str]  class Transaction(BaseModel):     user: User  my_user = User(hobbies=['reading']) t = Transaction(user=my_user) print(t) #> user=User(hobbies=['reading'])  my_user.hobbies = [1] t = Transaction(user=my_user)  # (2)! print(t) #> user=User(hobbies=[1])  my_sub_user = SubUser(hobbies=['scuba diving'], sins=['lying']) t = Transaction(user=my_sub_user) print(t)  # (3)! #> user=User(hobbies=['scuba diving'])`

1.  `revalidate_instances` is set to `'subclass-instances'`.
2.  This is not revalidated, since `my_user` is not a subclass of `User`.
3.  Using `'never'` we would have gotten `user=SubUser(hobbies=['scuba diving'], sins=['lying'])`.

### ser\_json\_timedelta `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.ser_json_timedelta "Permanent link")

`ser_json_timedelta: [Literal](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Literal "typing.Literal") ['iso8601', 'float']`

The format of JSON serialized timedeltas. Accepts the string values of `'iso8601'` and `'float'`. Defaults to `'iso8601'`.

*   `'iso8601'` will serialize timedeltas to ISO 8601 durations.
*   `'float'` will serialize timedeltas to the total number of seconds.

### ser\_json\_bytes `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.ser_json_bytes "Permanent link")

`ser_json_bytes: [Literal](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Literal "typing.Literal") ['utf8', 'base64', 'hex']`

The encoding of JSON serialized bytes. Defaults to `'utf8'`. Set equal to `val_json_bytes` to get back an equal value after serialization round trip.

*   `'utf8'` will serialize bytes to UTF-8 strings.
*   `'base64'` will serialize bytes to URL safe base64 strings.
*   `'hex'` will serialize bytes to hexadecimal strings.

### val\_json\_bytes `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.val_json_bytes "Permanent link")

`val_json_bytes: [Literal](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Literal "typing.Literal") ['utf8', 'base64', 'hex']`

The encoding of JSON serialized bytes to decode. Defaults to `'utf8'`. Set equal to `ser_json_bytes` to get back an equal value after serialization round trip.

*   `'utf8'` will deserialize UTF-8 strings to bytes.
*   `'base64'` will deserialize URL safe base64 strings to bytes.
*   `'hex'` will deserialize hexadecimal strings to bytes.

### ser\_json\_inf\_nan `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.ser_json_inf_nan "Permanent link")

`ser_json_inf_nan: [Literal](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Literal "typing.Literal") ['null', 'constants', 'strings']`

The encoding of JSON serialized infinity and NaN float values. Defaults to `'null'`.

*   `'null'` will serialize infinity and NaN values as `null`.
*   `'constants'` will serialize infinity and NaN values as `Infinity` and `NaN`.
*   `'strings'` will serialize infinity as string `"Infinity"` and NaN as string `"NaN"`.

### validate\_default `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.validate_default "Permanent link")

`validate_default: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

Whether to validate default values during validation. Defaults to `False`.

### validate\_return `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.validate_return "Permanent link")

`validate_return: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

Whether to validate the return value from call validators. Defaults to `False`.

### protected\_namespaces `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.protected_namespaces "Permanent link")

`protected_namespaces: [tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple) [[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)  | [Pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.Pattern "re.Pattern") [[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) ], ...]`

A `tuple` of strings and/or patterns that prevent models from having fields with names that conflict with them. For strings, we match on a prefix basis. Ex, if 'dog' is in the protected namespace, 'dog\_name' will be protected. For patterns, we match on the entire field name. Ex, if `re.compile(r'^dog$')` is in the protected namespace, 'dog' will be protected, but 'dog\_name' will not be. Defaults to `('model_validate', 'model_dump',)`.

The reason we've selected these is to prevent collisions with other validation / dumping formats in the future - ex, `model_validate_{some_newly_supported_format}`.

Before v2.10, Pydantic used `('model_',)` as the default value for this setting to prevent collisions between model attributes and `BaseModel`'s own methods. This was changed in v2.10 given feedback that this restriction was limiting in AI and data science contexts, where it is common to have fields with names like `model_id`, `model_input`, `model_output`, etc.

For more details, see https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/10315.

``import warnings  from pydantic import BaseModel  warnings.filterwarnings('error')  # Raise warnings as errors  try:      class Model(BaseModel):         model_dump_something: str  except UserWarning as e:     print(e)     '''     Field "model_dump_something" in Model has conflict with protected namespace "model_dump".      You may be able to resolve this warning by setting `model_config['protected_namespaces'] = ('model_validate',)`.     '''``

You can customize this behavior using the `protected_namespaces` setting:

``import re import warnings  from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict  with warnings.catch_warnings(record=True) as caught_warnings:     warnings.simplefilter('always')  # Catch all warnings      class Model(BaseModel):         safe_field: str         also_protect_field: str         protect_this: str          model_config = ConfigDict(             protected_namespaces=(                 'protect_me_',                 'also_protect_',                 re.compile('^protect_this$'),             )         )  for warning in caught_warnings:     print(f'{warning.message}')     '''     Field "also_protect_field" in Model has conflict with protected namespace "also_protect_".     You may be able to resolve this warning by setting `model_config['protected_namespaces'] = ('protect_me_', re.compile('^protect_this$'))`.      Field "protect_this" in Model has conflict with protected namespace "re.compile('^protect_this$')".     You may be able to resolve this warning by setting `model_config['protected_namespaces'] = ('protect_me_', 'also_protect_')`.     '''``

While Pydantic will only emit a warning when an item is in a protected namespace but does not actually have a collision, an error _is_ raised if there is an actual collision with an existing attribute:

`from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict  try:      class Model(BaseModel):         model_validate: str          model_config = ConfigDict(protected_namespaces=('model_',))  except NameError as e:     print(e)     '''     Field "model_validate" conflicts with member <bound method BaseModel.model_validate of <class 'pydantic.main.BaseModel'>> of protected namespace "model_".     '''`

### hide\_input\_in\_errors `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.hide_input_in_errors "Permanent link")

`hide_input_in_errors: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

Whether to hide inputs when printing errors. Defaults to `False`.

Pydantic shows the input value and type when it raises `ValidationError` during the validation.

`from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError  class Model(BaseModel):     a: str  try:     Model(a=123) except ValidationError as e:     print(e)     '''     1 validation error for Model     a       Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=123, input_type=int]     '''`

You can hide the input value and type by setting the `hide_input_in_errors` config to `True`.

`from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict, ValidationError  class Model(BaseModel):     a: str     model_config = ConfigDict(hide_input_in_errors=True)  try:     Model(a=123) except ValidationError as e:     print(e)     '''     1 validation error for Model     a       Input should be a valid string [type=string_type]     '''`

### defer\_build `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.defer_build "Permanent link")

`defer_build: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

Whether to defer model validator and serializer construction until the first model validation. Defaults to False.

This can be useful to avoid the overhead of building models which are only used nested within other models, or when you want to manually define type namespace via [`Model.model_rebuild(_types_namespace=...)`](../base_model/#pydantic.BaseModel.model_rebuild)
.

Since v2.10, this setting also applies to pydantic dataclasses and TypeAdapter instances.

### plugin\_settings `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.plugin_settings "Permanent link")

`plugin_settings: [dict](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#dict) [[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) , [object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-object) ] | None`

A `dict` of settings for plugins. Defaults to `None`.

### schema\_generator `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.schema_generator "Permanent link")

`schema_generator: [type](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-type) [GenerateSchema] | None`

Warning

`schema_generator` is deprecated in v2.10.

Prior to v2.10, this setting was advertised as highly subject to change. It's possible that this interface may once again become public once the internal core schema generation API is more stable, but that will likely come after significant performance improvements have been made.

### json\_schema\_serialization\_defaults\_required `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.json_schema_serialization_defaults_required "Permanent link")

`json_schema_serialization_defaults_required: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

Whether fields with default values should be marked as required in the serialization schema. Defaults to `False`.

This ensures that the serialization schema will reflect the fact a field with a default will always be present when serializing the model, even though it is not required for validation.

However, there are scenarios where this may be undesirable — in particular, if you want to share the schema between validation and serialization, and don't mind fields with defaults being marked as not required during serialization. See [#7209](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/7209)
 for more details.

`from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict  class Model(BaseModel):     a: str = 'a'      model_config = ConfigDict(json_schema_serialization_defaults_required=True)  print(Model.model_json_schema(mode='validation')) ''' {     'properties': {'a': {'default': 'a', 'title': 'A', 'type': 'string'}},     'title': 'Model',     'type': 'object', } ''' print(Model.model_json_schema(mode='serialization')) ''' {     'properties': {'a': {'default': 'a', 'title': 'A', 'type': 'string'}},     'required': ['a'],     'title': 'Model',     'type': 'object', } '''`

### json\_schema\_mode\_override `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.json_schema_mode_override "Permanent link")

`json_schema_mode_override: [Literal](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Literal "typing.Literal") [     "validation", "serialization", None ]`

If not `None`, the specified mode will be used to generate the JSON schema regardless of what `mode` was passed to the function call. Defaults to `None`.

This provides a way to force the JSON schema generation to reflect a specific mode, e.g., to always use the validation schema.

It can be useful when using frameworks (such as FastAPI) that may generate different schemas for validation and serialization that must both be referenced from the same schema; when this happens, we automatically append `-Input` to the definition reference for the validation schema and `-Output` to the definition reference for the serialization schema. By specifying a `json_schema_mode_override` though, this prevents the conflict between the validation and serialization schemas (since both will use the specified schema), and so prevents the suffixes from being added to the definition references.

`from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict, Json  class Model(BaseModel):     a: Json[int]  # requires a string to validate, but will dump an int  print(Model.model_json_schema(mode='serialization')) ''' {     'properties': {'a': {'title': 'A', 'type': 'integer'}},     'required': ['a'],     'title': 'Model',     'type': 'object', } '''  class ForceInputModel(Model):     # the following ensures that even with mode='serialization', we     # will get the schema that would be generated for validation.     model_config = ConfigDict(json_schema_mode_override='validation')  print(ForceInputModel.model_json_schema(mode='serialization')) ''' {     'properties': {         'a': {             'contentMediaType': 'application/json',             'contentSchema': {'type': 'integer'},             'title': 'A',             'type': 'string',         }     },     'required': ['a'],     'title': 'ForceInputModel',     'type': 'object', } '''`

### coerce\_numbers\_to\_str `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.coerce_numbers_to_str "Permanent link")

`coerce_numbers_to_str: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

If `True`, enables automatic coercion of any `Number` type to `str` in "lax" (non-strict) mode. Defaults to `False`.

Pydantic doesn't allow number types (`int`, `float`, `Decimal`) to be coerced as type `str` by default.

`from decimal import Decimal  from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict, ValidationError  class Model(BaseModel):     value: str  try:     print(Model(value=42)) except ValidationError as e:     print(e)     '''     1 validation error for Model     value       Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=42, input_type=int]     '''  class Model(BaseModel):     model_config = ConfigDict(coerce_numbers_to_str=True)      value: str  repr(Model(value=42).value) #> "42" repr(Model(value=42.13).value) #> "42.13" repr(Model(value=Decimal('42.13')).value) #> "42.13"`

### regex\_engine `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.regex_engine "Permanent link")

`regex_engine: [Literal](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Literal "typing.Literal") ['rust-regex', 'python-re']`

The regex engine to be used for pattern validation. Defaults to `'rust-regex'`.

*   `rust-regex` uses the [`regex`](https://docs.rs/regex)
     Rust crate, which is non-backtracking and therefore more DDoS resistant, but does not support all regex features.
*   `python-re` use the [`re`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)
     module, which supports all regex features, but may be slower.

Note

If you use a compiled regex pattern, the python-re engine will be used regardless of this setting. This is so that flags such as `re.IGNORECASE` are respected.

`from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict, Field, ValidationError  class Model(BaseModel):     model_config = ConfigDict(regex_engine='python-re')      value: str = Field(pattern=r'^abc(?=def)')  print(Model(value='abcdef').value) #> abcdef  try:     print(Model(value='abxyzcdef')) except ValidationError as e:     print(e)     '''     1 validation error for Model     value       String should match pattern '^abc(?=def)' [type=string_pattern_mismatch, input_value='abxyzcdef', input_type=str]     '''`

### validation\_error\_cause `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.validation_error_cause "Permanent link")

`validation_error_cause: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

If `True`, Python exceptions that were part of a validation failure will be shown as an exception group as a cause. Can be useful for debugging. Defaults to `False`.

Note

Python 3.10 and older don't support exception groups natively. <=3.10, backport must be installed: `pip install exceptiongroup`.

Note

The structure of validation errors are likely to change in future Pydantic versions. Pydantic offers no guarantees about their structure. Should be used for visual traceback debugging only.

### use\_attribute\_docstrings `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.use_attribute_docstrings "Permanent link")

`use_attribute_docstrings: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

Whether docstrings of attributes (bare string literals immediately following the attribute declaration) should be used for field descriptions. Defaults to `False`.

Available in Pydantic v2.7+.

`from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict, Field  class Model(BaseModel):     model_config = ConfigDict(use_attribute_docstrings=True)      x: str     """     Example of an attribute docstring     """      y: int = Field(description="Description in Field")     """     Description in Field overrides attribute docstring     """  print(Model.model_fields["x"].description) # > Example of an attribute docstring print(Model.model_fields["y"].description) # > Description in Field`

This requires the source code of the class to be available at runtime.

Usage with `TypedDict` and stdlib dataclasses

Due to current limitations, attribute docstrings detection may not work as expected when using [`TypedDict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict)
 and stdlib dataclasses, in particular when:

*   inheritance is being used.
*   multiple classes have the same name in the same source file.

### cache\_strings `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.cache_strings "Permanent link")

`cache_strings: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)  | [Literal](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Literal "typing.Literal") ['all', 'keys', 'none']`

Whether to cache strings to avoid constructing new Python objects. Defaults to True.

Enabling this setting should significantly improve validation performance while increasing memory usage slightly.

*   `True` or `'all'` (the default): cache all strings
*   `'keys'`: cache only dictionary keys
*   `False` or `'none'`: no caching

Note

`True` or `'all'` is required to cache strings during general validation because validators don't know if they're in a key or a value.

Tip

If repeated strings are rare, it's recommended to use `'keys'` or `'none'` to reduce memory usage, as the performance difference is minimal if repeated strings are rare.

### validate\_by\_alias `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.validate_by_alias "Permanent link")

`validate_by_alias: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

Whether an aliased field may be populated by its alias. Defaults to `True`.

Note

In v2.11, `validate_by_alias` was introduced in conjunction with [`validate_by_name`](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.validate_by_name)
 to empower users with more fine grained validation control. In <v2.11, disabling validation by alias was not possible.

Here's an example of disabling validation by alias:

`from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict, Field  class Model(BaseModel):     model_config = ConfigDict(validate_by_name=True, validate_by_alias=False)      my_field: str = Field(validation_alias='my_alias')  # (1)!  m = Model(my_field='foo')  # (2)! print(m) #> my_field='foo'`

1.  The field `'my_field'` has an alias `'my_alias'`.
2.  The model can only be populated by the attribute name `'my_field'`.

Warning

You cannot set both `validate_by_alias` and `validate_by_name` to `False`. This would make it impossible to populate an attribute.

See [usage errors](../../errors/usage_errors/#validate-by-alias-and-name-false)
 for an example.

If you set `validate_by_alias` to `False`, under the hood, Pydantic dynamically sets `validate_by_name` to `True` to ensure that validation can still occur.

### validate\_by\_name `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.validate_by_name "Permanent link")

`validate_by_name: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

Whether an aliased field may be populated by its name as given by the model attribute. Defaults to `False`.

Note

In v2.0-v2.10, the `populate_by_name` configuration setting was used to specify whether or not a field could be populated by its name **and** alias.

In v2.11, `validate_by_name` was introduced in conjunction with [`validate_by_alias`](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.validate_by_alias)
 to empower users with more fine grained validation behavior control.

`from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict, Field  class Model(BaseModel):     model_config = ConfigDict(validate_by_name=True, validate_by_alias=True)      my_field: str = Field(validation_alias='my_alias')  # (1)!  m = Model(my_alias='foo')  # (2)! print(m) #> my_field='foo'  m = Model(my_field='foo')  # (3)! print(m) #> my_field='foo'`

1.  The field `'my_field'` has an alias `'my_alias'`.
2.  The model is populated by the alias `'my_alias'`.
3.  The model is populated by the attribute name `'my_field'`.

Warning

You cannot set both `validate_by_alias` and `validate_by_name` to `False`. This would make it impossible to populate an attribute.

See [usage errors](../../errors/usage_errors/#validate-by-alias-and-name-false)
 for an example.

### serialize\_by\_alias `instance-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.config.ConfigDict.serialize_by_alias "Permanent link")

`serialize_by_alias: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

Whether an aliased field should be serialized by its alias. Defaults to `False`.

Note: In v2.11, `serialize_by_alias` was introduced to address the [popular request](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/8379)
 for consistency with alias behavior for validation and serialization settings. In v3, the default value is expected to change to `True` for consistency with the validation default.

`from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict, Field  class Model(BaseModel):     model_config = ConfigDict(serialize_by_alias=True)      my_field: str = Field(serialization_alias='my_alias')  # (1)!  m = Model(my_field='foo') print(m.model_dump())  # (2)! #> {'my_alias': 'foo'}`

1.  The field `'my_field'` has an alias `'my_alias'`.
2.  The model is serialized using the alias `'my_alias'` for the `'my_field'` attribute.

Usage Documentation

[Configuration with other types](../../concepts/config/#configuration-on-other-supported-types)

A convenience decorator to set a [Pydantic configuration](./)
 on a `TypedDict` or a `dataclass` from the standard library.

Although the configuration can be set using the `__pydantic_config__` attribute, it does not play well with type checkers, especially with `TypedDict`.

Usage

`from typing_extensions import TypedDict  from pydantic import ConfigDict, TypeAdapter, with_config  @with_config(ConfigDict(str_to_lower=True)) class TD(TypedDict):     x: str  ta = TypeAdapter(TD)  print(ta.validate_python({'x': 'ABC'})) #> {'x': 'abc'}`

Try to rebuild the pydantic-core schema for the dataclass.

This may be necessary when one of the annotations is a ForwardRef which could not be resolved during the initial attempt to build the schema, and automatic rebuilding fails.

This is analogous to `BaseModel.model_rebuild`.

Parameters:

| `raise_errors` | `[bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool) ` | Whether to raise errors, defaults to `True`. | `True` |
| `_parent_namespace_depth` | `[int](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int) ` | The depth level of the parent namespace, defaults to 2. | `2` |
| `_types_namespace` | `MappingNamespace \| None` | The types namespace, defaults to `None`. | `None` |

Returns:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `[bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)  \| None` | Returns `None` if the schema is already "complete" and rebuilding was not required. |
| `[bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)  \| None` | If rebuilding _was_ required, returns `True` if rebuilding was successful, otherwise `False`. |

# Experimental - Pydantic

 



Pipeline API[¶](#pipeline-api "Permanent link")

================================================

Experimental pipeline API functionality. Be careful with this API, it's subject to change.

\_Pipeline `dataclass` [¶](#pydantic.experimental.pipeline._Pipeline "Permanent link")

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`_Pipeline(_steps: [tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple) [_Step, ...])`

Bases: `[Generic](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Generic "typing.Generic") [_InT, _OutT]`

Abstract representation of a chain of validation, transformation, and parsing steps.

### transform [¶](#pydantic.experimental.pipeline._Pipeline.transform "Permanent link")

`transform(     func: [Callable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Callable "typing.Callable") [[_OutT], _NewOutT] ) -> [_Pipeline](#pydantic.experimental.pipeline._Pipeline "pydantic.experimental.pipeline._Pipeline") [_InT, _NewOutT]`

Transform the output of the previous step.

If used as the first step in a pipeline, the type of the field is used. That is, the transformation is applied to after the value is parsed to the field's type.

Validate / parse the input into a new type.

If no type is provided, the type of the field is used.

Types are parsed in Pydantic's `lax` mode by default, but you can enable `strict` mode by passing `strict=True`.

Creates a new instance of the `Model` class with validated data.

Creates a new model setting `__dict__` and `__pydantic_fields_set__` from trusted or pre-validated data. Default values are respected, but no other validation is performed.

Note

`model_construct()` generally respects the `model_config.extra` setting on the provided model. That is, if `model_config.extra == 'allow'`, then all extra passed values are added to the model instance's `__dict__` and `__pydantic_extra__` fields. If `model_config.extra == 'ignore'` (the default), then all extra passed values are ignored. Because no validation is performed with a call to `model_construct()`, having `model_config.extra == 'forbid'` does not result in an error if extra values are passed, but they will be ignored.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `_fields_set` | `[set](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#set) [[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) ] \| None` | A set of field names that were originally explicitly set during instantiation. If provided, this is directly used for the [`model_fields_set`](#pydantic.BaseModel.model_fields_set)<br> attribute. Otherwise, the field names from the `values` argument will be used. | `None` |
| `values` | `[Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") ` | Trusted or pre-validated data dictionary. | `{}` |

Returns:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |

[`model_copy`](../../concepts/serialization/#model_copy)

Returns a copy of the model.

Note

The underlying instance's [`__dict__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__dict__)
 attribute is copied. This might have unexpected side effects if you store anything in it, on top of the model fields (e.g. the value of [cached properties](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.cached_property)
).

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `update` | `[Mapping](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Mapping "collections.abc.Mapping") [[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) , [Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") ] \| None` | Values to change/add in the new model. Note: the data is not validated before creating the new model. You should trust this data. | `None` |
| `deep` | `[bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool) ` | Set to `True` to make a deep copy of the model. | `False` |

Returns:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Self` | New model instance. |

# Network Types - Pydantic

 



Network Types
=============

The networks module contains types for common network-related fields.

MAX\_EMAIL\_LENGTH `module-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.networks.MAX_EMAIL_LENGTH "Permanent link")

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`MAX_EMAIL_LENGTH = 2048`

Maximum length for an email. A somewhat arbitrary but very generous number compared to what is allowed by most implementations.

UrlConstraints `dataclass` [¶](#pydantic.networks.UrlConstraints "Permanent link")

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`UrlConstraints(     max_length: [int](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int)  | None = None,     allowed_schemes: [list](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-list) [[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) ] | None = None,     host_required: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)  | None = None,     default_host: [str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)  | None = None,     default_port: [int](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int)  | None = None,     default_path: [str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)  | None = None, )`

Url constraints.

Attributes:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `max_length` | `[int](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int)  \| None` | The maximum length of the url. Defaults to `None`. |
| `allowed_schemes` | `[list](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-list) [[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) ] \| None` | The allowed schemes. Defaults to `None`. |
| `host_required` | `[bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)  \| None` | Whether the host is required. Defaults to `None`. |
| `default_host` | `[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)  \| None` | The default host. Defaults to `None`. |
| `default_port` | `[int](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int)  \| None` | The default port. Defaults to `None`. |
| `default_path` | `[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)  \| None` | The default path. Defaults to `None`. |

### defined\_constraints `property` [¶](#pydantic.networks.UrlConstraints.defined_constraints "Permanent link")

`defined_constraints: [dict](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#dict) [[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) , [Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") ]`

Fetch a key / value mapping of constraints to values that are not None. Used for core schema updates.

AnyUrl [¶](#pydantic.networks.AnyUrl "Permanent link")

-------------------------------------------------------

`AnyUrl(url: [str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)  | [Url](../pydantic_core/#pydantic_core.Url "pydantic_core.Url")  | _BaseUrl)`

Bases: `_BaseUrl`

Base type for all URLs.

*   Any scheme allowed
*   Top-level domain (TLD) not required
*   Host not required

Assuming an input URL of `http://samuel:[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) :8000/the/path/?query=here#fragment=is;this=bit`, the types export the following properties:

*   `scheme`: the URL scheme (`http`), always set.
*   `host`: the URL host (`example.com`).
*   `username`: optional username if included (`samuel`).
*   `password`: optional password if included (`pass`).
*   `port`: optional port (`8000`).
*   `path`: optional path (`/the/path/`).
*   `query`: optional URL query (for example, `GET` arguments or "search string", such as `query=here`).
*   `fragment`: optional fragment (`fragment=is;this=bit`).

| 127<br>128 | `def __init__(self, url: str \| _CoreUrl \| _BaseUrl) -> None:     self._url = _build_type_adapter(self.__class__).validate_python(url)._url` |

AnyHttpUrl [¶](#pydantic.networks.AnyHttpUrl "Permanent link")

---------------------------------------------------------------

`AnyHttpUrl(url: [str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)  | [Url](../pydantic_core/#pydantic_core.Url "pydantic_core.Url")  | _BaseUrl)`

Bases: `[AnyUrl](#pydantic.networks.AnyUrl "pydantic.networks.AnyUrl") `

A type that will accept any http or https URL.

*   TLD not required
*   Host not required

Source code in `pydantic/networks.py`

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 127<br>128 | `def __init__(self, url: str \| _CoreUrl \| _BaseUrl) -> None:     self._url = _build_type_adapter(self.__class__).validate_python(url)._url` |

HttpUrl [¶](#pydantic.networks.HttpUrl "Permanent link")

---------------------------------------------------------

`HttpUrl(url: [str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)  | [Url](../pydantic_core/#pydantic_core.Url "pydantic_core.Url")  | _BaseUrl)`

Bases: `[AnyUrl](#pydantic.networks.AnyUrl "pydantic.networks.AnyUrl") `

A type that will accept any http or https URL.

*   TLD not required
*   Host not required
*   Max length 2083

`from pydantic import BaseModel, HttpUrl, ValidationError  class MyModel(BaseModel):     url: HttpUrl  m = MyModel(url='http://www.example.com')  # (1)! print(m.url) #> http://www.example.com/  try:     MyModel(url='ftp://invalid.url') except ValidationError as e:     print(e)     '''     1 validation error for MyModel     url       URL scheme should be 'http' or 'https' [type=url_scheme, input_value='ftp://invalid.url', input_type=str]     '''  try:     MyModel(url='not a url') except ValidationError as e:     print(e)     '''     1 validation error for MyModel     url       Input should be a valid URL, relative URL without a base [type=url_parsing, input_value='not a url', input_type=str]     '''`

1.  Note: mypy would prefer `m = MyModel(url=HttpUrl('http://www.example.com'))`, but Pydantic will convert the string to an HttpUrl instance anyway.

"International domains" (e.g. a URL where the host or TLD includes non-ascii characters) will be encoded via [punycode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode)
 (see [this article](https://www.xudongz.com/blog/2017/idn-phishing/)
 for a good description of why this is important):

`from pydantic import BaseModel, HttpUrl  class MyModel(BaseModel):     url: HttpUrl  m1 = MyModel(url='http://puny£code.com') print(m1.url) #> http://xn--punycode-eja.com/ m2 = MyModel(url='https://www.аррӏе.com/') print(m2.url) #> https://www.xn--80ak6aa92e.com/ m3 = MyModel(url='https://www.example.珠宝/') print(m3.url) #> https://www.example.xn--pbt977c/`

Underscores in Hostnames

In Pydantic, underscores are allowed in all parts of a domain except the TLD. Technically this might be wrong - in theory the hostname cannot have underscores, but subdomains can.

To explain this; consider the following two cases:

*   `exam_ple.co.uk`: the hostname is `exam_ple`, which should not be allowed since it contains an underscore.
*   `foo_bar.example.com` the hostname is `example`, which should be allowed since the underscore is in the subdomain.

Without having an exhaustive list of TLDs, it would be impossible to differentiate between these two. Therefore underscores are allowed, but you can always do further validation in a validator if desired.

Also, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari all currently accept `http://exam_ple.com` as a URL, so we're in good (or at least big) company.

Usage Documentation

[Fields](../../concepts/fields/)

Create a field for objects that can be configured.

Used to provide extra information about a field, either for the model schema or complex validation. Some arguments apply only to number fields (`int`, `float`, `Decimal`) and some apply only to `str`.

Note

*   Any `_Unset` objects will be replaced by the corresponding value defined in the `_DefaultValues` dictionary. If a key for the `_Unset` object is not found in the `_DefaultValues` dictionary, it will default to `None`

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

FieldInfo [¶](#pydantic.fields.FieldInfo "Permanent link")

-----------------------------------------------------------

`FieldInfo(**kwargs: Unpack[_FieldInfoInputs])`

Bases: `Representation`

This class holds information about a field.

`FieldInfo` is used for any field definition regardless of whether the [`Field()`](#pydantic.fields.Field)
 function is explicitly used.

Warning

You generally shouldn't be creating `FieldInfo` directly, you'll only need to use it when accessing [`BaseModel`](../base_model/#pydantic.BaseModel)
 `.model_fields` internals.

Attributes:

| Name | Type | Description |

Create a new `FieldInfo` object with the `Field` function.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `default` | `[Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") ` | The default value for the field. Defaults to Undefined. | `PydanticUndefined` |
| `**kwargs` | `Unpack[_FromFieldInfoInputs]` | Additional arguments dictionary. | `{}` |

Raises:

| Type | Description |

Creates a `FieldInfo` instance from a bare annotation.

This function is used internally to create a `FieldInfo` from a bare annotation like this:

`import pydantic  class MyModel(pydantic.BaseModel):     foo: int  # <-- like this`

We also account for the case where the annotation can be an instance of `Annotated` and where one of the (not first) arguments in `Annotated` is an instance of `FieldInfo`, e.g.:

`from typing import Annotated  import annotated_types  import pydantic  class MyModel(pydantic.BaseModel):     foo: Annotated[int, annotated_types.Gt(42)]     bar: Annotated[int, pydantic.Field(gt=42)]`

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `annotation` | `[type](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-type) [[Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") ]` | An annotation object. | _required_ |

Returns:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `[FieldInfo](#pydantic.fields.FieldInfo "pydantic.fields.FieldInfo") ` | An instance of the field metadata. |

`rebuild_annotation() -> [Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any")`

Attempts to rebuild the original annotation for use in function signatures.

If metadata is present, it adds it to the original annotation using `Annotated`. Otherwise, it returns the original annotation as-is.

Note that because the metadata has been flattened, the original annotation may not be reconstructed exactly as originally provided, e.g. if the original type had unrecognized annotations, or was annotated with a call to `pydantic.Field`.

Usage Documentation

[Private Model Attributes](../../concepts/models/#private-model-attributes)

Indicates that an attribute is intended for private use and not handled during normal validation/serialization.

Private attributes are not validated by Pydantic, so it's up to you to ensure they are used in a type-safe manner.

Private attributes are stored in `__private_attributes__` on the model.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `default` | `[Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") ` | The attribute's default value. Defaults to Undefined. | `PydanticUndefined` |
| `default_factory` | `[Callable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Callable "typing.Callable") [[], [Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") ] \| None` | Callable that will be called when a default value is needed for this attribute. If both `default` and `default_factory` are set, an error will be raised. | `None` |
| `init` | `[Literal](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Literal "typing.Literal") [False]` | Whether the attribute should be included in the constructor of the dataclass. Always `False`. | `False` |

Returns:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `[Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") ` | An instance of [`ModelPrivateAttr`](#pydantic.fields.ModelPrivateAttr)<br> class. |

Raises:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `[ValueError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError) ` | If both `default` and `default_factory` are set. |

Usage Documentation

[The `computed_field` decorator](../../concepts/fields/#the-computed_field-decorator)

Decorator to include `property` and `cached_property` when serializing models or dataclasses.

This is useful for fields that are computed from other fields, or for fields that are expensive to compute and should be cached.

`from pydantic import BaseModel, computed_field  class Rectangle(BaseModel):     width: int     length: int      @computed_field     @property     def area(self) -> int:         return self.width * self.length  print(Rectangle(width=3, length=2).model_dump()) #> {'width': 3, 'length': 2, 'area': 6}`

If applied to functions not yet decorated with `@property` or `@cached_property`, the function is automatically wrapped with `property`. Although this is more concise, you will lose IntelliSense in your IDE, and confuse static type checkers, thus explicit use of `@property` is recommended.

Mypy Warning

Even with the `@property` or `@cached_property` applied to your function before `@computed_field`, mypy may throw a `Decorated property not supported` error. See [mypy issue #1362](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/1362)
, for more information. To avoid this error message, add `# type: ignore[prop-decorator]` to the `@computed_field` line.

[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright)
 supports `@computed_field` without error.

``import random  from pydantic import BaseModel, computed_field  class Square(BaseModel):     width: float      @computed_field     def area(self) -> float:  # converted to a `property` by `computed_field`         return round(self.width**2, 2)      @area.setter     def area(self, new_area: float) -> None:         self.width = new_area**0.5      @computed_field(alias='the magic number', repr=False)     def random_number(self) -> int:         return random.randint(0, 1_000)  square = Square(width=1.3)  # `random_number` does not appear in representation print(repr(square)) #> Square(width=1.3, area=1.69)  print(square.random_number) #> 3  square.area = 4  print(square.model_dump_json(by_alias=True)) #> {"width":2.0,"area":4.0,"the magic number":3}``

Overriding with `computed_field`

You can't override a field from a parent class with a `computed_field` in the child class. `mypy` complains about this behavior if allowed, and `dataclasses` doesn't allow this pattern either. See the example below:

`from pydantic import BaseModel, computed_field  class Parent(BaseModel):     a: str  try:      class Child(Parent):         @computed_field         @property         def a(self) -> str:             return 'new a'  except TypeError as e:     print(e)     '''     Field 'a' of class 'Child' overrides symbol of same name in a parent class. This override with a computed_field is incompatible.     '''`

Private properties decorated with `@computed_field` have `repr=False` by default.

`from functools import cached_property  from pydantic import BaseModel, computed_field  class Model(BaseModel):     foo: int      @computed_field     @cached_property     def _private_cached_property(self) -> int:         return -self.foo      @computed_field     @property     def _private_property(self) -> int:         return -self.foo  m = Model(foo=1) print(repr(m)) #> Model(foo=1)`

| `description` | `[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)  \| None` | Description to use when including this computed field in JSON Schema, defaults to the function's docstring | `None` |
| `deprecated` | `Deprecated \| [str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)  \| [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)  \| None` | A deprecation message (or an instance of `warnings.deprecated` or the `typing_extensions.deprecated` backport). to be emitted when accessing the field. Or a boolean. This will automatically be set if the property is decorated with the `deprecated` decorator. | `None` |
| `examples` | `[list](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-list) [[Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") ] \| None` | Example values to use when including this computed field in JSON Schema | `None` |

| `repr` | `[bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)  \| None` | whether to include this computed field in model repr. Default is `False` for private properties and `True` for public properties. | `None` |
| `return_type` | `[Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") ` | optional return for serialization logic to expect when serializing to JSON, if included this must be correct, otherwise a `TypeError` is raised. If you don't include a return type Any is used, which does runtime introspection to handle arbitrary objects. | `PydanticUndefined` |

Returns:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `PropertyT \| [Callable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Callable "typing.Callable") [[PropertyT], PropertyT]` | A proxy wrapper for the property. |

PlainSerializer `dataclass` [¶](#pydantic.functional_serializers.PlainSerializer "Permanent link")

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`PlainSerializer(     func: SerializerFunction,     return_type: [Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any")  = PydanticUndefined,     when_used: [WhenUsed](../pydantic_core_schema/#pydantic_core.core_schema.WhenUsed "pydantic_core.core_schema.WhenUsed")  = "always", )`

Plain serializers use a function to modify the output of serialization.

This is particularly helpful when you want to customize the serialization for annotated types. Consider an input of `list`, which will be serialized into a space-delimited string.

`from typing import Annotated  from pydantic import BaseModel, PlainSerializer  CustomStr = Annotated[     list, PlainSerializer(lambda x: ' '.join(x), return_type=str) ]  class StudentModel(BaseModel):     courses: CustomStr  student = StudentModel(courses=['Math', 'Chemistry', 'English']) print(student.model_dump()) #> {'courses': 'Math Chemistry English'}`

Attributes:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `func` | `SerializerFunction` | The serializer function. |
| `return_type` | `[Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") ` | The return type for the function. If omitted it will be inferred from the type annotation. |
| `when_used` | `[WhenUsed](../pydantic_core_schema/#pydantic_core.core_schema.WhenUsed "pydantic_core.core_schema.WhenUsed") ` | Determines when this serializer should be used. Accepts a string with values `'always'`, `'unless-none'`, `'json'`, and `'json-unless-none'`. Defaults to 'always'. |

WrapSerializer `dataclass` [¶](#pydantic.functional_serializers.WrapSerializer "Permanent link")

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`WrapSerializer(     func: WrapSerializerFunction,     return_type: [Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any")  = PydanticUndefined,     when_used: [WhenUsed](../pydantic_core_schema/#pydantic_core.core_schema.WhenUsed "pydantic_core.core_schema.WhenUsed")  = "always", )`

Wrap serializers receive the raw inputs along with a handler function that applies the standard serialization logic, and can modify the resulting value before returning it as the final output of serialization.

For example, here's a scenario in which a wrap serializer transforms timezones to UTC **and** utilizes the existing `datetime` serialization logic.

``from datetime import datetime, timezone from typing import Annotated, Any  from pydantic import BaseModel, WrapSerializer  class EventDatetime(BaseModel):     start: datetime     end: datetime  def convert_to_utc(value: Any, handler, info) -> dict[str, datetime]:     # Note that `handler` can actually help serialize the `value` for     # further custom serialization in case it's a subclass.     partial_result = handler(value, info)     if info.mode == 'json':         return {             k: datetime.fromisoformat(v).astimezone(timezone.utc)             for k, v in partial_result.items()         }     return {k: v.astimezone(timezone.utc) for k, v in partial_result.items()}  UTCEventDatetime = Annotated[EventDatetime, WrapSerializer(convert_to_utc)]  class EventModel(BaseModel):     event_datetime: UTCEventDatetime  dt = EventDatetime(     start='2024-01-01T07:00:00-08:00', end='2024-01-03T20:00:00+06:00' ) event = EventModel(event_datetime=dt) print(event.model_dump()) ''' {     'event_datetime': {         'start': datetime.datetime(             2024, 1, 1, 15, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc         ),         'end': datetime.datetime(             2024, 1, 3, 14, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc         ),     } } '''  print(event.model_dump_json()) ''' {"event_datetime":{"start":"2024-01-01T15:00:00Z","end":"2024-01-03T14:00:00Z"}} '''``

Attributes:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `func` | `WrapSerializerFunction` | The serializer function to be wrapped. |
| `return_type` | `[Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") ` | The return type for the function. If omitted it will be inferred from the type annotation. |
| `when_used` | `[WhenUsed](../pydantic_core_schema/#pydantic_core.core_schema.WhenUsed "pydantic_core.core_schema.WhenUsed") ` | Determines when this serializer should be used. Accepts a string with values `'always'`, `'unless-none'`, `'json'`, and `'json-unless-none'`. Defaults to 'always'. |

Decorator that enables custom field serialization.

In the below example, a field of type `set` is used to mitigate duplication. A `field_serializer` is used to serialize the data as a sorted list.

`from typing import Set  from pydantic import BaseModel, field_serializer  class StudentModel(BaseModel):     name: str = 'Jane'     courses: Set[str]      @field_serializer('courses', when_used='json')     def serialize_courses_in_order(self, courses: Set[str]):         return sorted(courses)  student = StudentModel(courses={'Math', 'Chemistry', 'English'}) print(student.model_dump_json()) #> {"name":"Jane","courses":["Chemistry","English","Math"]}`

See [Custom serializers](../../concepts/serialization/#custom-serializers)
 for more information.

Four signatures are supported:

*   `(self, value: Any, info: FieldSerializationInfo)`
*   `(self, value: Any, nxt: SerializerFunctionWrapHandler, info: FieldSerializationInfo)`
*   `(value: Any, info: SerializationInfo)`
*   `(value: Any, nxt: SerializerFunctionWrapHandler, info: SerializationInfo)`

Decorator that enables custom model serialization.

This is useful when a model need to be serialized in a customized manner, allowing for flexibility beyond just specific fields.

An example would be to serialize temperature to the same temperature scale, such as degrees Celsius.

`from typing import Literal  from pydantic import BaseModel, model_serializer  class TemperatureModel(BaseModel):     unit: Literal['C', 'F']     value: int      @model_serializer()     def serialize_model(self):         if self.unit == 'F':             return {'unit': 'C', 'value': int((self.value - 32) / 1.8)}         return {'unit': self.unit, 'value': self.value}  temperature = TemperatureModel(unit='F', value=212) print(temperature.model_dump()) #> {'unit': 'C', 'value': 100}`

Two signatures are supported for `mode='plain'`, which is the default:

*   `(self)`
*   `(self, info: SerializationInfo)`

And two other signatures for `mode='wrap'`:

*   `(self, nxt: SerializerFunctionWrapHandler)`
*   `(self, nxt: SerializerFunctionWrapHandler, info: SerializationInfo)`
    
    See [Custom serializers](../../concepts/serialization/#custom-serializers)
     for more information.
    

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `f` | `_ModelPlainSerializerT \| _ModelWrapSerializerT \| None` | The function to be decorated. | `None` |
| `mode` | `[Literal](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Literal "typing.Literal") ['plain', 'wrap']` | The serialization mode.<br><br>*   `'plain'` means the function will be called instead of the default serialization logic<br>*   `'wrap'` means the function will be called with an argument to optionally call the default serialization logic. | `'plain'` |
| `when_used` | `[WhenUsed](../pydantic_core_schema/#pydantic_core.core_schema.WhenUsed "pydantic_core.core_schema.WhenUsed") ` | Determines when this serializer should be used. | `'always'` |
| `return_type` | `[Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") ` | The return type for the function. If omitted it will be inferred from the type annotation. | `PydanticUndefined` |

Returns:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `_ModelPlainSerializerT \| [Callable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Callable "typing.Callable") [[_ModelWrapSerializerT], _ModelWrapSerializerT] \| [Callable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Callable "typing.Callable") [[_ModelPlainSerializerT], _ModelPlainSerializerT]` | The decorator function. |

Returns:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `[Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") ` | The validated object. |

### isinstance\_python [¶](#pydantic_core.SchemaValidator.isinstance_python "Permanent link")

`isinstance_python(     input: [Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") ,     *,     strict: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)  | None = None,     from_attributes: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)  | None = None,     context: [Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any")  | None = None,     self_instance: [Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any")  | None = None,     by_alias: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)  | None = None,     by_name: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)  | None = None ) -> [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)`

Similar to [`validate_python()`](#pydantic_core.SchemaValidator.validate_python)
 but returns a boolean.

Arguments match `validate_python()`. This method will not raise `ValidationError`s but will raise internal errors.

Returns:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `[bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool) ` | `True` if validation succeeds, `False` if validation fails. |

### validate\_json [¶](#pydantic_core.SchemaValidator.validate_json "Permanent link")

Validate JSON data directly against the schema and return the validated Python object.

This method should be significantly faster than `validate_python(json.loads(json_data))` as it avoids the need to create intermediate Python objects

It also handles constructing the correct Python type even in strict mode, where `validate_python(json.loads(json_data))` would fail validation.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `input` | `[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)  \| [bytes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes)  \| [bytearray](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytearray) ` | The JSON data to validate. | _required_ |
| `strict` | `[bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)  \| None` | Whether to validate the object in strict mode. If `None`, the value of [`CoreConfig.strict`](../pydantic_core_schema/#pydantic_core.core_schema.CoreConfig)<br> is used. | `None` |
| `context` | `[Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any")  \| None` | The context to use for validation, this is passed to functional validators as [`info.context`](../pydantic_core_schema/#pydantic_core.core_schema.ValidationInfo.context)<br>. | `None` |
| `self_instance` | `[Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any")  \| None` | An instance of a model set attributes on from validation. | `None` |
| `allow_partial` | `[bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)  \| [Literal](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Literal "typing.Literal") ['off', 'on', 'trailing-strings']` | Whether to allow partial validation; if `True` incomplete JSON will be parsed successfully and errors in the last element of sequences and mappings are ignored. `'trailing-strings'` means any final unfinished JSON string is included in the result. | `False` |
| `by_alias` | `[bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)  \| None` | Whether to use the field's alias when validating against the provided input data. | `None` |
| `by_name` | `[bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)  \| None` | Whether to use the field's name when validating against the provided input data. | `None` |

Raises:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `[ValidationError](#pydantic_core.ValidationError "pydantic_core._pydantic_core.ValidationError") ` | If validation fails or if the JSON data is invalid. |
| `[Exception](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception) ` | Other error types maybe raised if internal errors occur. |

Returns:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `[Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") ` | The validated Python object. |

### validate\_strings [¶](#pydantic_core.SchemaValidator.validate_strings "Permanent link")

`validate_strings(     input: _StringInput,     *,     strict: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)  | None = None,     context: [Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any")  | None = None,     allow_partial: (         [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)  | [Literal](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Literal "typing.Literal") ["off", "on", "trailing-strings"]     ) = False,     by_alias: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)  | None = None,     by_name: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)  | None = None ) -> [Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any")`

This is similar to `validate_json` but applies to scenarios where the input will be a string but not JSON data, e.g. URL fragments, query parameters, etc.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `input` | `_StringInput` | The input as a string, or bytes/bytearray if `strict=False`. | _required_ |

| `context` | `[Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any")  \| None` | The context to use for validation, this is passed to functional validators as [`info.context`](../pydantic_core_schema/#pydantic_core.core_schema.ValidationInfo.context)<br>. | `None` |
| `allow_partial` | `[bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)  \| [Literal](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Literal "typing.Literal") ['off', 'on', 'trailing-strings']` | Whether to allow partial validation; if `True` errors in the last element of sequences and mappings are ignored. `'trailing-strings'` means any final unfinished JSON string is included in the result. | `False` |
| `by_alias` | `[bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)  \| None` | Whether to use the field's alias when validating against the provided input data. | `None` |

PydanticOmit [¶](#pydantic_core.PydanticOmit "Permanent link")

---------------------------------------------------------------

Bases: `[Exception](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception) `

An exception to signal that a field should be omitted from a generated result.

This could span from omitting a field from a JSON Schema to omitting a field from a serialized result. Upcoming: more robust support for using PydanticOmit in custom serializers is still in development. Right now, this is primarily used in the JSON Schema generation process.

Example

`from typing import Callable  from pydantic_core import PydanticOmit  from pydantic import BaseModel from pydantic.json_schema import GenerateJsonSchema, JsonSchemaValue  class MyGenerateJsonSchema(GenerateJsonSchema):     def handle_invalid_for_json_schema(self, schema, error_info) -> JsonSchemaValue:         raise PydanticOmit  class Predicate(BaseModel):     name: str = 'no-op'     func: Callable = lambda x: x  instance_example = Predicate()  validation_schema = instance_example.model_json_schema(schema_generator=MyGenerateJsonSchema, mode='validation') print(validation_schema) ''' {'properties': {'name': {'default': 'no-op', 'title': 'Name', 'type': 'string'}}, 'title': 'Predicate', 'type': 'object'} '''`

For a more in depth example / explanation, see the [customizing JSON schema](../../concepts/json_schema/#customizing-the-json-schema-generation-process)
 docs.

PydanticUseDefault [¶](#pydantic_core.PydanticUseDefault "Permanent link")

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bases: `[Exception](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception) `

An exception to signal that standard validation either failed or should be skipped, and the default value should be used instead.

This warning can be raised in custom valiation functions to redirect the flow of validation.

Example

`from pydantic_core import PydanticUseDefault from datetime import datetime from pydantic import BaseModel, field_validator  class Event(BaseModel):     name: str = 'meeting'     time: datetime      @field_validator('name', mode='plain')     def name_must_be_present(cls, v) -> str:         if not v or not isinstance(v, str):             raise PydanticUseDefault()         return v  event1 = Event(name='party', time=datetime(2024, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)) print(repr(event1)) # > Event(name='party', time=datetime.datetime(2024, 1, 1, 12, 0)) event2 = Event(time=datetime(2024, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)) print(repr(event2)) # > Event(name='meeting', time=datetime.datetime(2024, 1, 1, 12, 0))`

For an additional example, see the [validating partial json data](../../concepts/json/#partial-json-parsing)
 section of the Pydantic documentation.

PydanticSerializationError [¶](#pydantic_core.PydanticSerializationError "Permanent link")

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`PydanticSerializationError(message: [str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) )`

Bases: `[ValueError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError) `

An error raised when an issue occurs during serialization.

In custom serializers, this error can be used to indicate that serialization has failed.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `message` | `[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) ` | The message associated with the error. | _required_ |

PydanticSerializationUnexpectedValue [¶](#pydantic_core.PydanticSerializationUnexpectedValue "Permanent link")

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`PydanticSerializationUnexpectedValue(message: [str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) )`

Bases: `[ValueError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError) `

An error raised when an unexpected value is encountered during serialization.

This error is often caught and coerced into a warning, as `pydantic-core` generally makes a best attempt at serializing values, in contrast with validation where errors are eagerly raised.

Example

``from pydantic import BaseModel, field_serializer from pydantic_core import PydanticSerializationUnexpectedValue  class BasicPoint(BaseModel):     x: int     y: int      @field_serializer('*')     def serialize(self, v):         if not isinstance(v, int):             raise PydanticSerializationUnexpectedValue(f'Expected type `int`, got {type(v)} with value {v}')         return v  point = BasicPoint(x=1, y=2) # some sort of mutation point.x = 'a'  print(point.model_dump()) ''' UserWarning: Pydantic serializer warnings: PydanticSerializationUnexpectedValue(Expected type `int`, got <class 'str'> with value a) return self.__pydantic_serializer__.to_python( {'x': 'a', 'y': 2} '''``

This is often used internally in `pydantic-core` when unexpected types are encountered during serialization, but it can also be used by users in custom serializers, as seen above.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `message` | `[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) ` | The message associated with the unexpected value. | _required_ |

# Functional Validators - Pydantic

 



Functional Validators
=====================

This module contains related classes and functions for validation.

ModelAfterValidatorWithoutInfo `module-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.functional_validators.ModelAfterValidatorWithoutInfo "Permanent link")

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`ModelAfterValidatorWithoutInfo = [Callable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Callable "typing.Callable") [     [_ModelType], _ModelType ]`

A `@model_validator` decorated function signature. This is used when `mode='after'` and the function does not have info argument.

ModelAfterValidator `module-attribute` [¶](#pydantic.functional_validators.ModelAfterValidator "Permanent link")

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`ModelAfterValidator = [Callable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Callable "typing.Callable") [     [_ModelType, [ValidationInfo](../pydantic_core_schema/#pydantic_core.core_schema.ValidationInfo "pydantic_core.core_schema.ValidationInfo") ], _ModelType ]`

A `@model_validator` decorated function signature. This is used when `mode='after'`.

AfterValidator `dataclass` [¶](#pydantic.functional_validators.AfterValidator "Permanent link")

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`AfterValidator(     func: (         NoInfoValidatorFunction | WithInfoValidatorFunction     ), )`

Usage Documentation

[field _after_ validators](../../concepts/validators/#field-after-validator)

A metadata class that indicates that a validation should be applied **after** the inner validation logic.

Attributes:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `func` | `NoInfoValidatorFunction \| WithInfoValidatorFunction` | The validator function. |

Example

`from typing import Annotated  from pydantic import AfterValidator, BaseModel, ValidationError  MyInt = Annotated[int, AfterValidator(lambda v: v + 1)]  class Model(BaseModel):     a: MyInt  print(Model(a=1).a) #> 2  try:     Model(a='a') except ValidationError as e:     print(e.json(indent=2))     '''     [       {         "type": "int_parsing",         "loc": [           "a"         ],         "msg": "Input should be a valid integer, unable to parse string as an integer",         "input": "a",         "url": "https://errors.pydantic.dev/2/v/int_parsing"       }     ]     '''`

BeforeValidator `dataclass` [¶](#pydantic.functional_validators.BeforeValidator "Permanent link")

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`BeforeValidator(     func: (         NoInfoValidatorFunction | WithInfoValidatorFunction     ),     json_schema_input_type: [Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any")  = PydanticUndefined, )`

Usage Documentation

[field _before_ validators](../../concepts/validators/#field-before-validator)

A metadata class that indicates that a validation should be applied **before** the inner validation logic.

Attributes:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `func` | `NoInfoValidatorFunction \| WithInfoValidatorFunction` | The validator function. |
| `json_schema_input_type` | `[Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") ` | The input type of the function. This is only used to generate the appropriate JSON Schema (in validation mode). |

Example

`from typing import Annotated  from pydantic import BaseModel, BeforeValidator  MyInt = Annotated[int, BeforeValidator(lambda v: v + 1)]  class Model(BaseModel):     a: MyInt  print(Model(a=1).a) #> 2  try:     Model(a='a') except TypeError as e:     print(e)     #> can only concatenate str (not "int") to str`

PlainValidator `dataclass` [¶](#pydantic.functional_validators.PlainValidator "Permanent link")

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`PlainValidator(     func: (         NoInfoValidatorFunction | WithInfoValidatorFunction     ),     json_schema_input_type: [Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any")  = [Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") , )`

Usage Documentation

[field _plain_ validators](../../concepts/validators/#field-plain-validator)

A metadata class that indicates that a validation should be applied **instead** of the inner validation logic.

Note

Before v2.9, `PlainValidator` wasn't always compatible with JSON Schema generation for `mode='validation'`. You can now use the `json_schema_input_type` argument to specify the input type of the function to be used in the JSON schema when `mode='validation'` (the default). See the example below for more details.

Attributes:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `func` | `NoInfoValidatorFunction \| WithInfoValidatorFunction` | The validator function. |
| `json_schema_input_type` | `[Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") ` | The input type of the function. This is only used to generate the appropriate JSON Schema (in validation mode). If not provided, will default to `Any`. |

Example

`from typing import Annotated, Union  from pydantic import BaseModel, PlainValidator  MyInt = Annotated[     int,     PlainValidator(         lambda v: int(v) + 1, json_schema_input_type=Union[str, int]  # (1)!     ), ]  class Model(BaseModel):     a: MyInt  print(Model(a='1').a) #> 2  print(Model(a=1).a) #> 2`

1.  In this example, we've specified the `json_schema_input_type` as `Union[str, int]` which indicates to the JSON schema generator that in validation mode, the input type for the `a` field can be either a `str` or an `int`.

WrapValidator `dataclass` [¶](#pydantic.functional_validators.WrapValidator "Permanent link")

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`WrapValidator(     func: (         NoInfoWrapValidatorFunction         | WithInfoWrapValidatorFunction     ),     json_schema_input_type: [Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any")  = PydanticUndefined, )`

Usage Documentation

[field _wrap_ validators](../../concepts/validators/#field-wrap-validator)

A metadata class that indicates that a validation should be applied **around** the inner validation logic.

Attributes:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `func` | `NoInfoWrapValidatorFunction \| WithInfoWrapValidatorFunction` | The validator function. |
| `json_schema_input_type` | `[Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any") ` | The input type of the function. This is only used to generate the appropriate JSON Schema (in validation mode). |

`from datetime import datetime from typing import Annotated  from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError, WrapValidator  def validate_timestamp(v, handler):     if v == 'now':         # we don't want to bother with further validation, just return the new value         return datetime.now()     try:         return handler(v)     except ValidationError:         # validation failed, in this case we want to return a default value         return datetime(2000, 1, 1)  MyTimestamp = Annotated[datetime, WrapValidator(validate_timestamp)]  class Model(BaseModel):     a: MyTimestamp  print(Model(a='now').a) #> 2032-01-02 03:04:05.000006 print(Model(a='invalid').a) #> 2000-01-01 00:00:00`

ModelWrapValidatorHandler [¶](#pydantic.functional_validators.ModelWrapValidatorHandler "Permanent link")

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bases: `[Protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Protocol "typing.Protocol") [_ModelType]`

A `@model_validator` decorated function signature. This is used when `mode='wrap'`.

FreeModelBeforeValidatorWithoutInfo [¶](#pydantic.functional_validators.FreeModelBeforeValidatorWithoutInfo "Permanent link")

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bases: `[Protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Protocol "typing.Protocol") `

A `@model_validator` decorated function signature. This is used when `mode='before'` and the function does not have info argument.

ModelBeforeValidatorWithoutInfo [¶](#pydantic.functional_validators.ModelBeforeValidatorWithoutInfo "Permanent link")

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bases: `[Protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Protocol "typing.Protocol") `

A `@model_validator` decorated function signature. This is used when `mode='before'` and the function does not have info argument.

FreeModelBeforeValidator [¶](#pydantic.functional_validators.FreeModelBeforeValidator "Permanent link")

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bases: `[Protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Protocol "typing.Protocol") `

A `@model_validator` decorated function signature. This is used when `mode='before'`.

ModelBeforeValidator [¶](#pydantic.functional_validators.ModelBeforeValidator "Permanent link")

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bases: `[Protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Protocol "typing.Protocol") `

A `@model_validator` decorated function signature. This is used when `mode='before'`.

InstanceOf `dataclass` [¶](#pydantic.functional_validators.InstanceOf "Permanent link")

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`InstanceOf()`

Generic type for annotating a type that is an instance of a given class.

Example

`from pydantic import BaseModel, InstanceOf  class Foo:     ...  class Bar(BaseModel):     foo: InstanceOf[Foo]  Bar(foo=Foo()) try:     Bar(foo=42) except ValidationError as e:     print(e)     """     [     │   {     │   │   'type': 'is_instance_of',     │   │   'loc': ('foo',),     │   │   'msg': 'Input should be an instance of Foo',     │   │   'input': 42,     │   │   'ctx': {'class': 'Foo'},     │   │   'url': 'https://errors.pydantic.dev/0.38.0/v/is_instance_of'     │   }     ]     """`

SkipValidation `dataclass` [¶](#pydantic.functional_validators.SkipValidation "Permanent link")

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`SkipValidation()`

If this is applied as an annotation (e.g., via `x: Annotated[int, SkipValidation]`), validation will be skipped. You can also use `SkipValidation[int]` as a shorthand for `Annotated[int, SkipValidation]`.

This can be useful if you want to use a type annotation for documentation/IDE/type-checking purposes, and know that it is safe to skip validation for one or more of the fields.

Because this converts the validation schema to `any_schema`, subsequent annotation-applied transformations may not have the expected effects. Therefore, when used, this annotation should generally be the final annotation applied to a type.

field\_validator [¶](#pydantic.functional_validators.field_validator "Permanent link")

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`field_validator(     field: [str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) ,     /,     *fields: [str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) ,     mode: [Literal](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Literal "typing.Literal") ["wrap"],     check_fields: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)  | None = ...,     json_schema_input_type: [Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any "typing.Any")  = ..., ) -> [Callable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Callable "typing.Callable") [[_V2WrapValidatorType], _V2WrapValidatorType]`

`Coordinate(latitude: [Latitude](#pydantic_extra_types.coordinate.Latitude "pydantic_extra_types.coordinate.Latitude") , longitude: [Longitude](#pydantic_extra_types.coordinate.Longitude "pydantic_extra_types.coordinate.Longitude") )`

Bases: `Representation`

Coordinate parses Latitude and Longitude.

You can use the `Coordinate` data type for storing coordinates. Coordinates can be defined using one of the following formats:

1.  Tuple: `(Latitude, Longitude)`. For example: `(41.40338, 2.17403)`.
2.  `Coordinate` instance: `Coordinate(latitude=Latitude, longitude=Longitude)`.

`from pydantic import BaseModel  from pydantic_extra_types.coordinate import Coordinate  class Location(BaseModel):     coordinate: Coordinate  location = Location(coordinate=(41.40338, 2.17403)) #> coordinate=Coordinate(latitude=41.40338, longitude=2.17403)`

# Color - Pydantic

 



Color
=====

Color definitions are used as per the CSS3 [CSS Color Module Level 3](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#svg-color)
 specification.

A few colors have multiple names referring to the sames colors, eg. `grey` and `gray` or `aqua` and `cyan`.

In these cases the _last_ color when sorted alphabetically takes preferences, eg. `Color((0, 255, 255)).as_named() == 'cyan'` because "cyan" comes after "aqua".

RGBA [¶](#pydantic_extra_types.color.RGBA "Permanent link")

------------------------------------------------------------

`RGBA(r: [float](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float) , g: [float](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float) , b: [float](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float) , alpha: [float](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float)  | None)`

# Pendulum - Pydantic

 



Pendulum
========

Native Pendulum DateTime object implementation. This is a copy of the Pendulum DateTime object, but with a Pydantic CoreSchema implementation. This allows Pydantic to validate the DateTime object.

DateTime [¶](#pydantic_extra_types.pendulum_dt.DateTime "Permanent link")

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bases: `DateTime`

A `pendulum.DateTime` object. At runtime, this type decomposes into pendulum.DateTime automatically. This type exists because Pydantic throws a fit on unknown types.

`from pydantic import BaseModel from pydantic_extra_types.pendulum_dt import DateTime  class test_model(BaseModel):     dt: DateTime  print(test_model(dt='2021-01-01T00:00:00+00:00'))  #> test_model(dt=DateTime(2021, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=FixedTimezone(0, name="+00:00")))`

Date [¶](#pydantic_extra_types.pendulum_dt.Date "Permanent link")

------------------------------------------------------------------

Bases: `Date`

A `pendulum.Date` object. At runtime, this type decomposes into pendulum.Date automatically. This type exists because Pydantic throws a fit on unknown types.

`from pydantic import BaseModel from pydantic_extra_types.pendulum_dt import Date  class test_model(BaseModel):     dt: Date  print(test_model(dt='2021-01-01'))  #> test_model(dt=Date(2021, 1, 1))`

Duration [¶](#pydantic_extra_types.pendulum_dt.Duration "Permanent link")

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bases: `Duration`

A `pendulum.Duration` object. At runtime, this type decomposes into pendulum.Duration automatically. This type exists because Pydantic throws a fit on unknown types.

`from pydantic import BaseModel from pydantic_extra_types.pendulum_dt import Duration  class test_model(BaseModel):     delta_t: Duration  print(test_model(delta_t='P1DT25H'))  #> test_model(delta_t=Duration(days=2, hours=1))`

This method is included just to get a more accurate return type for type checkers. It is included in this `if TYPE_CHECKING:` block since no override is actually necessary.

See the documentation of `BaseModel.model_dump` for more details about the arguments.

Generally, this method will have a return type of `RootModelRootType`, assuming that `RootModelRootType` is not a `BaseModel` subclass. If `RootModelRootType` is a `BaseModel` subclass, then the return type will likely be `dict[str, Any]`, as `model_dump` calls are recursive. The return type could even be something different, in the case of a custom serializer. Thus, `Any` is used here to catch all of these cases.
