**5. Integration Strategy**

Seamless data and parameter flow between modules is paramount:
*   **SNA -> ML:** Network metrics calculated for nodes/edges in SNA are directly selectable as features for ML models.
*   **SNA -> ABM:** Network structures generated or analyzed in SNA define the interaction topology for ABM agents. Node metrics from SNA initialize agent attributes.
*   **Data -> All Modules:** Imported and preprocessed data provides the basis for network construction (SNA), feature engineering (ML), and agent/environment parameterization (ABM).
*   **ML -> ABM:** Patterns or predictive relationships identified by ML models inform agent behavioral rules or parameter settings in ABM.
*   **ABM -> SNA/ML:** Simulation outputs (e.g., time-series of agent states, emergent network structures over time) are exportable back to the SNA/ML modules for further analysis.

**6. Technology Stack Considerations (Guidance)**

*   The backend should leverage the Python scientific ecosystem, utilizing libraries like:
    *   Pandas for data manipulation.
    *   NetworkX for core graph representation and SNA calculations.
    *   Scikit-learn for ML algorithms and validation.
    *   Statsmodels for statistical testing.
    *   SHAP and LIME libraries for interpretability.
    *   Mesa or SimPy frameworks could form the basis of the ABM module, adapted for the OrgAl interface and integration needs.
*   The frontend should be a modern web framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) or a desktop application framework (e.g., Qt, Electron) providing a responsive and interactive GUI.
*   A Python API should be considered for advanced users needing programmatic access and integration with existing research pipelines.

**7. Conclusion**

By adhering to this specification, OrgAl will provide a powerful, integrated, and user-friendly platform that directly addresses the needs identified in the academic foundation document. It will lower the barrier to entry for applying advanced computational methods to organizational behavior research, foster methodological rigor and reproducibility, and ultimately enable significant advancements in understanding the complexities of organizational life.
